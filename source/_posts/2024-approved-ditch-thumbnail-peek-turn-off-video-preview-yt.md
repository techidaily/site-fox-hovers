#### 1\. Do you need to disable YouTube previews on all your devices?

No. YouTube offers you cross-platform functionality, meaning the changes apply to all devices you use to access your account. So, for example, YouTube thumbnail previews will be disabled across your desktop, smartphone, and tablet, regardless of where you made the change.

#### 2\. Can you disable YouTube video ads?

No. YouTubes relies heavily on advertising for revenue and does not offer the function in its Settings menu. However, you can customize them to suit your tastes by customizing your [**Google Ad Settings**](https://adssettings.google.com/). Please note the configuration is only possible when you log in to your account.

Alternatively, you can switch to YouTube Premium to enjoy ad-free content on YouTube and YouTube music.

You can use a third-party app blocker to prevent advertising content across all device platforms. However, not all ad blockers can disable YouTube ads. Therefore, ensure the function is available before purchasing the subscription. For example, Adblock VPN is an effective open-source web browser extension you can use for your mobile and desktop devices.
