##### Step4 Save or Share the Videos

At the end of your editing journey, you may use the complete Filmora editor as previously mentioned when you've done editing the recorded video. When you want to submit your creative work right away to YouTube or another well-known website, click the Export option and choose the platform where you want to share your video.

## Conclusion

With Internet’s evolution, it was difficult to predict the transformative effects these technologies would have on our entertainment, journalism, and companies. Windows Movie Maker 6.0 was the first program used in the production of YouTube videos. But today, Wondershare has the fulcrum of sound and video tools using its flagship product [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It works well for beginners and intermediate users so you won’t have any hurdles using it to the full extent.
