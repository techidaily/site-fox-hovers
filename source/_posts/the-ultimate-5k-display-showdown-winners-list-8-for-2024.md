 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The quality of the images professional and consumer [digital cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can capture has been improving steadily since the turn of the century. Today [cameras that can capture 4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or 8K footage have become the industry standard, which is why video editors are in constant need of monitors that can display high-resolution images accurately.

Moreover, programmers, graphic designers, and gamers often need more than what 4K monitors that are currently available on the market can offer. Even though the obvious solution to the shortcomings of 4K monitors lies in getting displays that have higher resolutions, 5K monitors are still not widely accepted by professionals across different industries. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best 5K monitors you can buy.

## What’s 5K Resolution?

Before we take a look at different models of 5K monitors, we are going to take a moment to shed some light on what 5K resolution actually is. The exact resolution of 5K monitors that have 16:9 aspect ratios can vary slightly depending on the model, but the most common 5K resolution is 5120X2880 or 14.7 million pixels.

![5k high resolution](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5k-high-resolution.jpg)

This means that 5K monitors offer 33.33% more pixels on both horizontal and vertical sides than 4K monitors. This extra space can be useful to video editors who want to view 4K footage at native resolution while still being able to see the interface of the app they are using to process it.

As [4K](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) content is growing more popular, 5K monitors are becoming more useful, which might make them more available on the markets around the globe in the next few years. However, 5K resolution is still not a standard digital cinematography format in 2024, since most video content creators opt to shoot their footage in Full HD or 4K resolution.

## 8 Best 5K Monitors for PC and Mac Computers

It has been a little over five years since the first 5K monitors hit the market, but even after all this time, the model selection is still scarce. Even so, nearly all 5K monitors are capable of stunning performances regardless of the purpose for which they are used. So, let’s take a look at the 8 best 5K monitors for PC and Mac computers you can buy in 2024.

### 1\. LG 34WK95U-W 34’’ UltraWide 5K2K Monitor

**Best for:** Graphic design, software development, video editing

**Price:**$1499.99

The minimalistic design of the ultrawide monitor makes it an appealing option for both private and professional settings. LG 34WK95U-W has an IPS panel with a 21:9 aspect ratio that has excellent viewing angles so that the position from which you are viewing the monitor doesn’t impact the quality of the image.

This 5K monitor provides a plethora of connection options, as it features two HDMI and USB ports, as well as a DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 3 port that ensures fast data transfers. Besides the HDR support the LG 34WK95U-W grants, your access to a plethora of split-screen options which can be particularly useful if you are working on demanding video editing projects. This LG’s 5K monitor ships with an adjustable stand, but if it is too large for the work surfaces you have in your office or at home, you can easily mount it to a wall.

**Pros**

* Accurate color depiction
* Supports joystick controls
* Enables viewers to display HDR images
* Modern and functional design

**Cons**

* The built-in speakers could be better
* Not the best choice for gaming

### 2\. LG 27MD5KB-B

**Best for:** artists, graphic designers, video editors

**Price:**$1,447.77

![LG 27MD5KB-B 5K monitor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/lg-27MD5KB-B-5k-monitor-for-mac.jpg)

MacBook Pro owners who are thinking of getting a 5K monitor should consider getting the LG 27MD5KB-B since this model is the product of the collaboration between Apple and LG. This a great option for a secondary screen, although you must purchase adapters if you want to use this 5K monitor with a PC computer.

Its color reproduction capabilities and a wide range of viewing angles make it suitable for creatives from a broad range of industries. Moreover, the LG 27MD5KB-B is equipped with integrated microphone, speakers, and a camera that enables you to communicate with your clients without using external headphone sets.

This 5K monitor features the ambient light sensor that adjusts the panel’s brightness automatically to provide the best viewing experience. In addition, this LG’s monitor has a powerful anti-glare coating and it provides consistent clarity regardless of the viewing conditions.

**Pros**

* Equipped with an ambient light sensor
* Excellent image quality

**Cons**

* The stand isn’t easily adjustable

### 3\. Iiyama ProLite XB2779QQS

**Best for:** Users who frequently work with text

**Price:**$954

![Iiyama ProLite XB2779QQS 5k monitor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iiyama-proLite-5k-monitor.jpg)

This is currently one the least expensive 5K monitor you can find on the market, so if Dell’s or LG’s model are too expensive for you, then Iiyama ProLite XB2779QQS may be a good alternative. However, you shouldn’t expect the same performances that pricier models of 5K monitors provide. In addition to a relatively complicated calibration process, the Iiyama ProLite XB2779QQS struggles to depict colors accurately even if you manage to calibrate it properly.

This 16:9 aspect ratio monitor looks a bit outdated as its thick bothers resemble monitor models from the early 2010s. Even though you can adjust the height, tilt or swivel of this monitor, its stand lacks stability, which is why it much better to mount it on the wall. Even so, Iiyama ProLite XB2779QQS is a budget-friendly option that provides solid picture quality to all of its users, while its fast response time and excellent native contrast make it an intriguing choice for creative industry professionals.

**Pros**

* Less expensive than the competition
* Wide viewing angles
* No flickering
* Fast response times

**Cons**

* No HDR support
* Doesn’t have USB hubs

4\.   **Planar IX2790**

**Best for:**Common use

![Planar 5K monitor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vplanar-5k-monitor.jpg)

Even though Planar is not one of the most recognizable names on the 5K monitor market, its IX2790 model provides excellent performances at a reasonable price. This bezel-free IPS LCD 5K monitor is modernly designed, and it fits perfectly to the office and any other working environment. All of the function buttons are located on the bottom bar so that you can access them quickly, but you must use them carefully as they are touch-sensitive. The wide horizontal and vertical viewing angle, as well as stunning color accuracy, make Planar IX2790 suitable for use in a broad range of contexts. However, professional video editors, graphic designers, and artists who work with digital images shouldn’t expect high-end performances more expensive 5K monitors can provide. Moreover, the monitor’s stand offers only modest tilting and height adjustment options, which is why it is much easier to mount IX2790 onto a wall.

**Pros**

* Versatile monitor that can be used for a broad range of purposes

**Cons**

* Limited connection capabilities

The VA LCD panel doesn’t have a viewing angle that is as wide as the viewing angle that you can expect from IPS panels, but the 1800R curvature ensures that all images displayed on this 5K monitor can be viewed from almost any horizontal or vertical angle.

* Equipped with a gaming and eye saver mode
* Low input lag

**Cons**
