 The gaming world is fast evolving in line with every gamers crave for a better gaming experience. As a matter of fact, there is a new technology in town i.e the 4k resolution also called Ultra HD which has entered the gaming world. The 4k resolution is supported by graphic cards which are not just up to date but also designed for this technology.

 Well, 4k resolution can be achieved by the use of good graphics card which we will look at later in depth. These graphic cards are expensive although there are surely others that are relatively cheap. Some gamers have even opted to use double graphic cards in a bid to try to achieve this resolution. This may work although in other instances it has failed to work as it is incompatible with machines that do not to support multiple cards. So if you are looking for the best graphic cards for 4K gaming then we have compiled a great list for you!

* Scalable link interface(SLI) can allow a user to combine two GPUs in the same machine and allow them to concurrently share processes. This makes processes more efficient
* The NVIDIA GPU Boost 3.0 is part of the feature that allows you to increase clock speed to improve performance as well as tilt during intense high-resolution gaming to reduce overheating

 **Cons**

* Expensive to purchase retailing @ $699
* There are cases of overheating in heavy usage
* This GPU features 4gb high bandwidth memory. Its ability to support 4k resolution comfortably lies in its cooling technology which is a liquid that is looped over and over.

 **Pros**

* This radiator like cooling system allows it to be smaller, less noisy and has the ability to handle high-resolution processes comfortably.
* It features the free sync technology that allows the graph card and monitor to communicate hence adjusting the monitors refresh rate to the frame rate being displayed by the graph. This increases efficiency
* It allows the desktop to have multiple screen display improving the gaming experience
* It also has a frame rate target control that allows you select the frames the game is going to need making the gaming smoother
* This GPU is compatible with the mother boards that allows multiple GPUS Installed allowing them to share processes hence increasing resolution
* It has zero core power technology that shuts down the GPU during idle time

 **Cons**

* Expensive to purchase retailing at @ $679

### Conclusion

 The gaming industry has been moving with the times allowing better resolution, faster games and achieving a virtual reality in HD as well as in 3D. With the graphics we have looked at we have been able to establish that this technology is driven by price, performance and the ability of the computer being used.

 From more expensive GPU to the budget ones we have to establish that users are interested in a better resolution that can achieve virtual reality with speed. Users are also interested in GPU devices that don't overheat as well as well as those that are compatible with the computer they plan to use. This technology will always be changing with the times so it is important to always buy one that gives value for money, versatile and bound to work for long.
