Beginning filmmakers may use LumaFusion to discover their voice via editing. Their work may be moved to a desktop software after their abilities have grown on mobile. To start fading audio using Luma Fusion, follow these steps:

Step2 LumaFusion allows for the automated synchronization of up to 12 camera sources and several audio tracks. When a clip is loaded into LumaFusion, touch on it to open it in the viewer and then adjust the start and finish points.

Step3 From the choices, choose the Cross Dissolve (Fade) transition. The transition should be placed at the very end of your music channel timeline. Tap on the Help & Settings menu to do this action. Look for Transition under the Settings menu and edit it to the appropriate duration. If you do this, your transition won't take effect until you add it again.
