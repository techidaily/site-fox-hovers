 Below are some of the leading VR headset companies which should be on your list for the best VR experience:

## Sony

Unlike others whose main focus is to use VR in gaming, Facebook hopes to use the technology in a wide variety of applications such as the facilitation of virtual meetings, virtual trips, teleportation etc.
