## Part 1\. What Is Video Resolution

If we speak in basic words, video resolution means the number of pixels displayed in each distinct dimension. The resolution of any video is usually written as a combination of height and width. If you want to know how clear the video is or how realistic it looks, then video resolution is that one element that will answer all your questions. Sounds intriguing, right?

With video resolution, you can see video images in any video recording. When you hear someone say the high-resolution video, the viewer can see a sharp and clear video. A higher number of pixels results in high quality and better resolution video. Ultra HD and Full HD are the two widely used video resolutions. Don't know much about them? Nothing to worry!

Whereas, whenever you come across the word low-resolution video or poor resolution video, it means that there is a low number of pixels. Now moving on, let us talk a little about the two significant types of video resolution. One is the default type, that's the 'Spatial Resolution.' It is measured in pixels with the height and the width. In contrast, the other type is the 'Temporal Resolution,' which is the frames rate.

## Part 2\. Types of Video Resolution List

The naming convention of these resolutions is based on how the pixels are running. It could either be a vertical line moving down the display area, or the movement could be across the frame in a horizontal line.

Want to know more about them? Without further delay, let us start sharing the video resolution list one by one. The order of types will be from low to high and Ultra HD.

### · Standard Definition Resolution (SD)

360p and 480p are the most popular standard definition (SD) resolutions.

Since the advancement of television and monitors, no one films in SD resolutions anymore. The world is changing, for sure!

360p resolution is still the most suitable option for smartphones and other mobile devices. This is because it uses less data. Whereas DVDs are the best example of using 480p resolution size.

03 [How to Select the Video Resolution to Shoot Your Video Better??](#part3)

## Part 1\. What Is Video Resolution

If we speak in basic words, video resolution means the number of pixels displayed in each distinct dimension. The resolution of any video is usually written as a combination of height and width. If you want to know how clear the video is or how realistic it looks, then video resolution is that one element that will answer all your questions. Sounds intriguing, right?

With video resolution, you can see video images in any video recording. When you hear someone say the high-resolution video, the viewer can see a sharp and clear video. A higher number of pixels results in high quality and better resolution video. Ultra HD and Full HD are the two widely used video resolutions. Don't know much about them? Nothing to worry!

Whereas, whenever you come across the word low-resolution video or poor resolution video, it means that there is a low number of pixels. Now moving on, let us talk a little about the two significant types of video resolution. One is the default type, that's the 'Spatial Resolution.' It is measured in pixels with the height and the width. In contrast, the other type is the 'Temporal Resolution,' which is the frames rate.

## Part 2\. Types of Video Resolution List

After discussing video resolution, now it's time to jump and discuss the list of video resolutions. There are various resolutions. The naming convention of these resolutions is based on how the pixels are running. It could either be a vertical line moving down the display area, or the movement could be across the frame in a horizontal line.

Want to know more about them? Without further delay, let us start sharing the video resolution list one by one. The order of types will be from low to high and Ultra HD.

Since the advancement of television and monitors, no one films in SD resolutions anymore. The world is changing, for sure!
