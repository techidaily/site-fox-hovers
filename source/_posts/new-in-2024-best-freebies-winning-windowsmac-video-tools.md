## FAQs About Windows10 Video Player

### 1\. How to Play DVDs in Windows 10 for Free?

Windows 10 doesn't have a dedicated DVD Player. Windows Media Center has been discontinued & replaced with Windows DVD Player. The app costs $15 in the Microsoft store and does not come preinstalled.

Users who upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7, or Windows 8 with Windows Media Center, are entitled to a free copy of Windows DVD Player. However, the app has many playback & compatibility issues, not to mention a large number of bugs. Free alternatives such as VLC Video Player are much better. Insert your DVD, open the VLC player, go to Media > Open Disc to watch it.

### 2\. What Is the Default Video Player for Windows 10?

Windows 10 comes with the Movies & TV app set as the default video player. With it, you can watch content from your collection, from rentals and purchases made on other Microsoft devices, or you can rent and buy new content.
