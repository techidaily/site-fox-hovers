## Part 4: Advantages and Disadvantages of Alight Motion App

According to our practical experience above, we can sort out the advantages and disadvantages of this application.

### Advantages

**Constant Improvement:** with every new version/update, there is always an improvement. This shows that in the nearest future, alight motion will bring lots of innovation to the video editing industry.

**Robust Basic Effect Building Blocks:** Alight Motion has over 100 effects building blocks giving you a wider range of choices when editing your videos.

**How-To-Use Tutorial:** Alight Motion video editing app gives you some basic knowledge of how to navigate through the app. This is a feature I consider amazing. It goes a long way for beginners

**Multiple Layers of Videos, Audios, and Graphics:** with this app, you can share your videos, audio, and graphics into multiple layers for more efficient editing.

**Android and IOS Support:** you can use this app on android and IOS devices.

**Advertisement Pop-Up (Free Version):** advertisement may pop up when using the alight motion app free version

**Watermark (Free Version):** if you are using an alight app free version, your video will have a watermark logo after editing it.

## Part 5: How To Add Motion To Your Video With Alight Motion Alternative

Some video editors prefer using desktop video editors because they can use multiple hard drives on it. High-definition footage requires a large amount of space that a smartphone can't offer. If a hard drive gets filled, you can change it with little or no interruption to your work.

If you don't want alight motion and you want to add motion to your videos, you can try its alternative [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora is a simple, entry-level desktop video editor. It has a lot of editing features that can help you create high-standard videos. You can use a few videos to create a video, edit the video audio, add filters, crop, and trim them all on Filmora.
