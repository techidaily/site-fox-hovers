## Part 1: Reasons Why You Pick Adobe Lightroom

This tool is the most powerful editor to empower your clicks and help you to capture and edit the best shots of yours.

Now it is necessary to find the reasons for picking adobe lightroom and some of the cons too.

Most of the users find the interface of the tool easier and they can find a way of working simply.

#### 2\. Cloud storage

The storage of the adobe lightroom is very much handy for the users who are working on the go needed some extra space on the desktop.

#### 3\. Sliders

Here sliders make it easier to get simple visuals on mobile as well as a desktop too.

#### 4\. Mobile & Desktop balance

The tools easily work in both the tool mobile and a desktop having cloud storage to keep things all together.

### The reasons why it is not worth pick

#### 1\. Some features are lacking

This tool still has to proceed with Lightroom Classic in some of the areas.

#### 2\. Lightroom classic vs. lightroom

Users still for the most advanced projects of editing need to pick the Classic version over the normal one.
