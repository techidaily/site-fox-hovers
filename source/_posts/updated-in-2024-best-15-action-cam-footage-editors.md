Here is a simple to use and intuitive movie maker for GoPro on Windows. It is a basic editing tool that can provide outstanding results for edited videos. Now you will be able to capture impressive videos, and they can be easily shared on social media platforms like YouTube and Vimeo, etc.

One of the shortcomings of Windows Movie Maker is that GoPro or action camera footage can't be directly imported into the program. As a result, you have to first convert the video footage into the formats supported by Movie Maker, like ASF, AVI, DVR-MS, M1V, MP2, MP2V, MPE, MPEG, MPG, MPV2, WM, WMV, etc.

**Note:** Even though Windows Movie Maker is not supported by Microsoft now, you will still be able to download and use it.

The answer is very simple: Filmora provides you with all the editing that professional software can do to make your video outstanding like in final cut pro which is not only very expensive but is difficult to use.

Moreover, it is so simple to use that a beginner can start his or her video creation journey very soon. At the same time, it will be so much easy for him or her.

![new project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/gopro-editing-filmora.png)
* Click on the **import button** to import the video from the documents to edit.  
**1\. Auto Synchronization tool.**  
Usually, when you shoot a video from a little farther apart, the voice will be very low and there will be a lot of noise hence very less sound will be recorded properly. To avoid audio issues, we try to take a cell phone in our pocket or hand and the distance of the camera does not affect the video and audio. Especially in prank videos, people have hidden cameras which is difficult to record proper audio. For this, we use a cell phone to record audio separately and video separately.  
Can you imagine how difficult it is to sync audio with video?  
Filmora has made it much easy. Filmora provides you with the **Auto Synchronization** feature in which you can join video and audio together.  
At last put **auto synchronization on.** It will automatically synchronize and adjust the audio according to the video. Let us start step by step:
* **Import** the desired video and audio in Filmora.
* Drag and drop the video in the video layer and the audio in the audio layer below the video layer.
* Select both the audio and the video clips and click on **Auto Sync** tool above the timeline.  
![gopro editing sync](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/gopro-editing-sync.png)
* It will automatically and perfectly sync the audio with the video without any mess.  
**2\.  Stock Audio in Filmora.**  
Many people use background music in their videos, especially vloggers and travel videos so it is difficult for them to find royalty-free music to avoid **copyright claims**. It also takes a lot of time to find stock audio or music for free. Filmora11 has the in-built feature of stock audio, let us learn how to use **stock audio** in our video. Let’s get started!
* Drag the desired footage into the timeline.
* Right-click on the clip and select the **Detach audio** tab. Your audio would be separated.  
![gopro editing audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/gopro-editing-audio.png)

* You will get a number of different **audio tracks,** you can pick and choose one or you can write the name of desired audio and select to drag and drop it into the timeline in the audio layer.  
![gopro editing audio1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/02/gopro-editing-audio1.png)  
**3\.  Stock Video or Image in Filmora.** Stock footage is same important for video editing. Especially, when you make a story, stock footage and images are required. You may need to show some, building, objects, or a person working. Let us discuss how to use these stock photos and video footage to make a professional video.
* Click on **stock Media,** here you will get multiple options like **Giphy, pixabay, Unsplash, etc.** in-built.
