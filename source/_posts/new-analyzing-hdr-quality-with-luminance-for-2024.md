1. HDR Processing

Luminance HDR separates the processing of HDR images into two phases: The creation of HDR images and its conversion to an LDR image.

So, in all, we could say the Luminance HDR processing is reliable.

Also, you can utilize ‘Portable' mode to put the Luminous HDR application on a USB stick with its settings.
