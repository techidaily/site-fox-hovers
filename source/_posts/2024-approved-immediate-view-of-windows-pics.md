* [FAQs](#part4)

## Part1: Why Windows 10 photos is not a good choice?

There are plenty of reasons why relying on Windows 10 photos for your creative work is a bad idea. Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.

#### **1\. It is slow**

The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10\. Regardless of your computer's specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:

* Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.
* Accessing the app through your **File Explorer menu** will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.

#### **2\. It is bad at batch process**

For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.

However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??

#### **3\. Program crash galore**

It is fine for computer software to crash occasionally. However, Windows 10 Photo Viewer takes it to the next level. The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.

#### **4\. Horrible user experience**

How quickly can you save a file to the cloud? Most programs take seconds. Unfortunately, using image viewer Windows 10 is a completely different ball game.?

First, you have to save a copy of your photo. Then, find the duplicate and then upload it to One Drive. What a nightmare!

## Part2: Top Best Fast Photo Viewer for Windows 10
