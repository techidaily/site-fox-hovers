If you still do not find any software to add text to your photos, you should also look at GIMP. It is also a good graphics editing program. Moreover, it is free and open source also. You can use it for both the editing and the manipulation of photos. Some people also still use WIMP for making their drawings, although it is not for such a purpose.
