It is a decidedly unprofessional touch. Keeping that thought in mind, you want to have handheld video stabilizer equipment on hand.

## Top Handheld Video Stabilizer Equipments

If budget is a concern of yours, try to focus on products that match how much you can realistically spend. Having said that, you should keep in mind that the prices of these video stabilizers can vary wildly from one product to the next. Some of them are quite expensive.

Here are a few options to consider:

#### 1\. [The Glidecam HD](http://www.glidecam.com/)

![glidecam hd 2000](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glidecam-hd-2000.jpg)

This is easily one of the most popular options to consider. The HD-2000 model is a good possibility, and that's going to run you about $549 dollars. Utilizing a gimbal, this product is great for low-profile cameras that weigh between two and six pounds. You will hold the device in one hand, and work the camera during a shoot with your other hand. The gimbal can be a little on the tricky side, but it is well worth mastering this thing.

#### 2\. [The Aviator Travel Jib:](http://www.aviatorcameragear.com/product/the-aviator-travel-jib-mag-alloy-kit/)

![Aviator Travel Jib](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Aviator-Travel-Jib.jpg)

For just $475 dollars, you can purchase this absolutely fantastic stabilizer from a number of different sources. This stabilizer is extremely lightweight, coming in at just under four pounds, and it is capable of extending up to six feet. Setting this thing up is a relative breeze, as well.

#### 3\. [The SteadyTracker :](http://www.cobracraneusa.com/steadytracker.html)

![steady tracker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/steady-tracker.jpg)

This is another example of a really popular stabilizer. You have a number of options available to you within the specific SteadyTracker product, but a lot of people seem to like the UltraLite version of the product, which you can have for around $190\. Weighing in at around 4.6 pounds, this stabilizer is capable of working with cameras that weigh as much as three pounds. By contrast, the Xtreme version of this product is capable of working with cameras that weigh as much as eight pounds. Additional features include comfortable gripping, the fact that it is extremely easy to set up, and the ability to allow for fluid motion.

#### 4\. [Benro Monopod](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/967701-REG/benro%5Fa48fbs4%5Fa48f%5Fclassic%5Faluminum%5Fmonopod%5Fs4.html/BI/5982/KBID/6868/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x431527)

![Benro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Benro.jpg)

Weighing just a little bit over six pounds, the Benro Monopod scores big with users for a couple of reasons. In the first place, you can get this stabilizer for under two hundred bucks, which definitely makes it one of the most affordable video stabilizers you are going to come across. In the second place, this product is extremely versatile. This is a monopod, and it is widely considered to be the best monopod for filmmaking. This stabilizer has features that include locking pan, drag adjustment capabilities, and tilt.

#### 5\. [Cinevate Duzi Slider](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1010735-REG/cinevate%5Finc%5Fciduzi02%5Fduzi%5Fcamera%5Fslider.html/BI/5982/KBID/6868/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x468844)

![cinevate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cinevate.jpg)

When you're looking for a stabilizer that is also a slider, the Cinevate Duzi Slider is definitely worth a look. At four hundred dollars, you will definitely want to make sure this is something you absolutely want. That said, this product is extremely lightweight at 3.6 pounds, and it has an impressive load capacity of seventy-five pounds.
