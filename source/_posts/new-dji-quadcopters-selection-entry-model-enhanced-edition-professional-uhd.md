[Check at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VSIT5UE/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00VSIT5UE&linkId=10a57de8b15401db69230146c6c6a001)

 There are so many features and specifications to discuss about Phantom 3 4k but at the same time it also lacks in so many abilities as compared to its predecessor and successors. You will be glad to know that it contains all features of Phantom 3 standard unit whereas the camera is advanced to get 4K view.

#### 3. DJI Phantom 3 Advanced:

[](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/phantom-3-advanced-1.jpg) ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AZ3KW7W/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01AZ3KW7W&linkId=7b385af4b8c68f4ac6031f35f7e66a95)

[Check at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01AZ3KW7W/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01AZ3KW7W&linkId=7b385af4b8c68f4ac6031f35f7e66a95)

 You have to pay $799 and you will gain access to all interesting features of Phantom 3 4K drone unit. But note that it will not provide you 4K footage. So if you are thinking hard about whether to compromise for this 4K ability or not then here is the best answer: after observations it is observed that reliability, range and video streaming ability of phantom 3 advanced is much better as compared to Phantom 3 4k. You will definitely get an impressive and useful model for your investment.

 If all conditions stay normal or favourable then the Lightbridge technology will assist Phantom 3 Advanced model to enjoy long flights, up to 5000 meters. It means you are able to travel 4.1 times farther as compared to your Phantom 3 4K model and this flight will be 5 times farther when compared to Phantom 3 standard.

 Further, This Advanced units are well equipped with GPS system that helps it in better tracking of global map during flights.

* Buttons are provided for playback, shutter and video recording operations.
* It works with advanced GPS system.
* Contains all features of Phantom 3 Standard unit.
**Pros:**
* Easy to use and control buttons ensure much better flight experience.
* DJI Lightbridge Video Downlink is a big advantage.
**Cons:**
* It can never provide you 4k recording ability.

#### 4. DJI Phantom 3 Professional:

[](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/phantom-3-pro-1.jpg) ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VSITBJO/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00VSITBJO&linkId=34ca14ab4478e81c607365535dacae01)

[Check at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VSITBJO/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00VSITBJO&linkId=34ca14ab4478e81c607365535dacae01)

 Same as Phantom 3 Advanced unit, the professional one possesses Lightbridge ability along with highly improved GPS system and 720p video feed. But you will be glad to know that it also offers 4k recording ability. The only difference among all previous models and professional one is that this unit comes with a big 100W charger that can complete full charging within one hour; whereas all other units use to consume 1.20 hours for full charging. So, in simple words, we can say that this Phantom 3 Professional unit is an All in One drone with impressive features.

 You need to pay $999 to get this product and believe me you will not be making any compromise for any requirement after having this awesome drone with you. It is well rated as a must buy drone for professionals as well as beginners.

## Conclusion

 All Phantom models are well designed and offer great features as per their price point. They focus on needs of regular users as well as on professional requirements. So we can say that none of these is a bad choice. If you are ready to buy a drone for your flight experience then it is important to make a list of all features and specifications first that you want to enjoy during your flights. Also have a look on your budget or savings. Then go for detailed comparison between these available phantom products and soon you will be able to choose the best drone unit for yourself.

 Let me remind you that, all these four models are equipped with GPS position hold feature, point of interest ability, follow me mode, waypoints, home lock, course lock, real time battery monitoring facility and the return to home feature. Further all of them offer flight time estimation feature, stabilized videos and photos along with manual camera exposure control. The only unique thing is the video resolution level and price that you need to focus upon; however these drones can ensure great details even at 720p resolution level due to gimbal support.
