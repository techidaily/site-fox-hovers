A Gimbal is usually designed with 3 brushless motors and they help operators to move their camera easily on all axis.

### Section 2: 2 Axis or 3 Axis Gimbal?

 You will generally find two types of gimbals in market: 2-axis and 3-axis. Selection for anyone of these totally depends upon your application.
