## Amplifying Image Size, Unchanged Crispness

# Best Image Enlargers: Making Photographs Larger Without Losing Quality

Resizing images is a routine step during the photo editing process. The size of all photos is often reduced in order to make a picture better suited for use on social media. On the other hand, enlarging a photo can be more complicated than it sounds. Increasing the overall number of pixels in a photo can easily cause pixelization, especially if the original photo was in low resolution. Blurriness, JPEG compression artifacts or image noise are also among frequent unwanted side effects of blowing up digital images.

Choosing the right software can help you avoid the potential dangers of enlarging images, which is the reason why we are going to take you through some of the best online as well as Mac and PC-based image enlargers.

## Enlarging Photos Online Without Compromising Quality

The resolution of an image determines how much that image can be enlarged without losing any quality. For instance, if the photo’s resolution is 600x400 pixels, trying to increase it up to 4000x3000 pixels can cause **blurriness or pixelization**. Let’s have a look at some of the best online tools for enlarging low-resolution photos, without compromising their quality.

#### 1. PhotoEnlarger

**Price:** Free

![best image enlarger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/photoenlarger-image-larger.jpg)

The largest resolution of a photo you can upload to PhotoEnlarger is limited to 1920X1080 pixels, which makes this tool perfectly suited for blowing up images that are relatively small in size. In order to import a photo, you can click on the Browse icon and navigate to the folder on your computer where the picture is stored or you can simply drag and drop the file to the **Select Image to Enlarge** area of the tool’s page. **The Scale** value is going to be set to **200%** by default, which means that your image is going to be **doubled in size**, and the PhotoEnlarger platform lets make your photo up to **four times larger than the original**. After selecting the Scale value or inserting new values into the **Width and Height boxes** you just have to click on the **Enlarge button** and wait for the picture to be enlarged. The four versions of the picture in different sizes are going to be generated you can crop each of them and download them.

#### 2. ImageEnlarger

**Price:** Free

![best image enlarger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imageenlarger-online-image-enlarger.jpg)

The largest file size you can upload to ImageEnlarger is limited **to 6MB**, while the maximum resolution is **4100X4100 pixels**. The platform offers support for **jpg, gif, png, and bmp** file formats and it lets you choose between **jpg and bmp output formats**. You can either upload a picture from your computer by clicking on the **Choose a File** button or use a **URL of an image stored online**. The maximum **Height and Weight values** of the enlarged photo produced with this online tool **cannot exceed** **4500 pixels**. The **Zoom Factor** option lets you choose how enlarged the photo is going to be and **Target Width and Target Height values** enable you to change the resolution of the image you’re enlarging. Click on the **Start button** to process the picture, and then choose the variation of the picture created with different filters you like the most. Simply **click on a version of a photo** to save it to your computer.

#### 3. **ResizeImage**

**Price:** Free

![best image enlarger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resizeimage-online-image-enlarger.jpg)

Besides offering the basic tools like rotate and crop images, the ResizeImage platform enables you to increase or decrease the size of your pictures. The crop option can be useful if you want to enlarge only a small portion of a photo. In the **Resize Your Image section** of the webpage you’ll be able to spot a **Scale slider**, but **its value can’t exceed 100%,** which means that you can’t use it to enlarge images.

![best image enlarger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resizeimage-online-image-enlarger-2.jpg)

Make sure that the **Keep Aspect Ratio** checkbox is selected to avoid distorting the picture, and then proceed to increase the values in the **Width and Height boxes**. If the original file had a width value of 1200 pixels you can double it to 2400 pixels without any risk of quality loss. The **height value** will be **adjusted automatically** if the Keep Aspect Ratio option is enabled. The new size of the photo will be displayed at the bottom of the screen. Directly above it is the **Resize button**, click on it and then click on the **Download Image button** to save a photo to a hard drive.

![best image enlarger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/resizeimage-online-image-enlarger-2.jpg)

#### 4. Waifu2x

**Price:** Free

![best image enlarger](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/waifu2x-online-image-enlarger.jpg)

This simple online image enlarger is based on a **Deep Convolutional Neural Network** and it can also produce the **Anime style art**. You can import an image by either **copying its URL** or by clicking on the **Choose a File button**. After you upload a photo you can choose between **Artwork and Photo styles**, select the **Photo option** and set a new level **of Noise Reduction**. When done, pick the **Upscaling option** that best fits the picture you’re enlarging and then click on the **Convert icon** to complete the process. Even though Waifu2x lets its users upscale images effortlessly, its tools are rudimentary. Using a more powerful photo editor will grant you more control over the photo enlargement process.

## Enlarging Photos Without Quality Loss on Windows and Mac OS

Nearly all modern photo editors offer a plethora of ways to increase or decrease the size of a photo, and they allow you to have much more freedom while enlarging a photo, than online-based solutions. Let’s have a look at some of the best image enlargers for Mac and PC computers.

Once the Image Size window pops up on your screen you just have to adjust the Pixel Dimensions or Document Size values.
