### How to Use Voicemeeter to Modify your Voice

Follow the detailed instructions below to edit your Vtube voice using Voicemeeter:

Step1 Download and install Voicemeeter from the official webpage via an internet-enabled computer system. Once the installation process is complete, restart your Windows operating system, and set up the app for usage.

Locate the **Start** icon at the bottom left corner of your screen and click on it.

![start](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-000.png)

Select **Settings** from the options that comes up, and the interface below will come up:

![settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-001.png)

Step2 Next, click on **Sounds** to configure some defaults

Click on the **Playback** panel, and scroll to where you have VoiceMeeter Input. Right-click on **VoiceMeeter Input** and a couple of options will come up. Select **Set as Default Device** to proceed.

![set as default device](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-002.png)

Next, right-click **VoiceMeeter Aux Input**, and select **Set as Default Communication Device**.

Locate the **VoiceMeeter Aux Input**, right-click on it and pick **Set as Default Device** from the options that appear underneath.

Step4 Now that you've successfully configured your computer sound system with VoiceMeeter, let's move to setting up the VoiceMeeter app itself. Open VoiceMeeter, and click the **HARDWARE INPUT 1, 2,** and **3**. Rename each of them. To do that, right-click on any one of the **HARDWARE INPUT** icon, and the screen below will come up:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Enter your preferred name in the space, and hit the **Enter** button on your keyboard. Once you are done with that, proceed to the next step.

Step5 Next, you need to set up the Virtual Audio Input section. There are three (3) Virtual Audio Inputs just as seen below:

![virtual audio input section](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-005.png)

Virtual Audio Input 1: This is where windows will send your voice recordings by default.

Virtual Audio Input 2: This is where windows send all of your communication traffic from social media platforms.

Virtual Audio Input 3: This is where windows will send signals from music apps like Spotify, etc.

Rename **Virtual Audio Input 1**, **2** & **3** as **PC Audio**, **Communication**, and **Music** respectively.

Step6 Once the above setup is complete, move to the **Hardware Outputs** section and configure it. There are 8 hardware output panels. You need to edit each one of them. Here is an image of what the output panels look like:

![hardware outputs](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/image-006-1.png)
