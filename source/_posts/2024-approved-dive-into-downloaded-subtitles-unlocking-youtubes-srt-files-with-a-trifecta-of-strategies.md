### Method 3: Get YouTube subtitles as .srt with Reliable Software

Using the software, you can add the already downloaded YouTube videos or can also use the Downloader function of the tool for downloading YouTube or any other video desired. A wide range of other video editing features is also supported by the software thus making it a complete video toolbox.

#### **2\. DVDVideoSoft**
