Snappa is one of my favorite sites for free images because it's easy to navigate, has a wide selection of photos and graphics, and doesn't require attribution or watermarks.

The site has an extensive library of free stock photos, vectors, mockups, and templates categorized by industry (e.g., technology), scene (e.g., cityscapes), and more.
