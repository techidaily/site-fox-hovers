Moreover, an Auto (preset color correction) tool is also added, which can help you fix your picture automatically.

The Lightroom app offers cloud support and a picture library that keeps your data in sync between your devices to help you access it anywhere, anytime. The app also provides an extensive export feature that allows you to set file type, quality, and dimension before saving the picture on your device.

It also provides you with non-destructive editing capabilities and RAW support features. These features allow you to edit their photos without permanently altering the originals and retain your RAW photos' full quality.

**Disadvantages:** Lightroom does not support printing or plugins. You can't print your photos directly from the app, nor can you use plugins to add extra features. The app doesn't have layer-based editing. Therefore, you can't make complex edits to your photos on the go.

Furthermore, the sharing feature is limited and does not allow you to share your picture directly with the Adobe Discover photo-sharing community.
