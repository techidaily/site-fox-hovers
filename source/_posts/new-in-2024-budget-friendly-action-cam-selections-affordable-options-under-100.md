## Factors to Consider When Buying Your Action or Sports Camera

 Those who are novice to the concept of motion video and photography should consider the following aspects seriously while choosing their action camera.

**Cost of the Camera:** Your budget determines the actual range while looking for the action cameras. Ideally, it can be hard to find a GoPro under $100\. Even a basic model is priced at $130\. While preparing a budget, you must also consider a checklist of supportive accessories and their prices.

**Supportive Accessories:** Though the manufacturers provide some basic gears such as waterproof housing with the camera, it is always necessary to purchase the most compatible high quality accessories that fit your camera best. Some basic requirements include mounts, tripods, filters, extended life batteries etc.

**Camera Specifications and Features:** At the end of the day, your picture or video quality is the main thing that matters. Decide what quality picture resolution or video shooting do you intend to achieve. Consider choosing highest pixel for photos and 4k resolution for best results with final edited video.

**Weather Resistance Protection:** Your action camera is exposed to moisture and fluctuating temperatures often. Your camera should have a waterproof housing or water resistant protection support to ensure greater durability.

**Camera Shape, Dimension and Weight:** The action camera is mostly mounted on the photographer’s body during high-speed mobility. Choose a camera with extremely compact design (preferably box shaped) and lightweight model for convenient mounting.
