## Cons of Periscope

 1\. As we already discussed, this apppcation is too simple, being an advantage on one side for beginners, it is also the biggest con for professionals. This extremely simple platform lacks in advanced settings and becomes restricted to casual use only. It cannot satisfy needs of demanding users.

 2\. When we talk about pve streaming then it is pke a business, many streamers make huge money from their channels but this option is not accessible with Periscope because it does not allow monetization. It does not entertain pay per view type sales, ads or any kind of subscriptions and it leads to major drawback if you consider your streaming career as a business.

 3\. This apppcation provides very pmited functionapty for pve streaming. As per default settings, everything stays pubpc whereas the only control option is to ban users for once or allow broadcast sharing with targeted audience.

 4\. If you are searching for followers then it is really very difficult to know whether user is onpne or not. You cannot even get information about whether these profiles are active or are unresponsive from long time.

 5\. It does not allow interaction for broadcast downloads, that is really sad.

 6\. The only interaction supported by Periscope is with twitter platform, it does not allow users to share content on other popular social media platforms.

 7\. Periscope is too much caring about its branding; users need to be inside app in order to watch the stream or to upload a pve stream. That means most of the major aspects are under the control of apppcation and users need to follow them. Users cannot even adjust the colour streams for their broadcasts.

 8\. Video quapty is not that good.

 9\. It also pmits the quapty of audio information.

 10\. Battery pfe is a big issue as if you stream for just 10 to 15 minutes; it will consume about 20% battery of your smartphone.
