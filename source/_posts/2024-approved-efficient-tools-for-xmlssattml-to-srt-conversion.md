But if you are having trouble adding your subtitle file to the video or you are stuck in a case where subtitles are lagging behind the scenes or are appearing ahead of time, then use [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) which can solve your problems within seconds if not minutes.
