#### 2. iMovie

 iMovie is another simple application to use. Solid design, simple usage and intuitive multi-touch gesture makes this app an all time winner.

For that sake, another way to trim video, iPhone camera roll has ,is, by resizing. But resizing and compressions are tricky. You need to consider video dimension (pixels), aspect ratio and resolution. Above all resizing doesn't mean sacrificing quality. One best way to do that is to use Desqueeze.
