For any channel to be a hit, the content plays a major role and PewDiePie clearly knows what the audience wants. The channel from his early days picks up the relevant topics that have also seen growth over the years. Having a niche in gaming content, there is no competition yet for PewDiePie.

**4\. Regular uploading of video**

Another important factor that makes PewDiePie popular is its regular video upload that keeps the subscribers interested and looking forward to the next one.

In addition to the above, entrepreneurial mind-set, eye-catchy content and visuals, and appreciation towards the fan are some of the many other reasons accounting for the success and popularity of PewDiePie.
