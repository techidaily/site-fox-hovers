## How To Find, Listen to and Download Podcasts on the iPhone?

While podcasts are an excellent method to learn about topics that interest you, data show that 48% of people who don't listen to podcasts don't know how to. We've assembled a guide to help you search, listen to, and download podcasts on your iPhone.

On your iPhone, open the Apple Podcasts app. Download it if you don't already have it. After launching the application, look for the "Browse" button on the toolbar at the bottom. You may find out what's hot or featured across several categories. Another option to find a podcast is to type its name into the "search" section.

When the results appear, tap on your chosen item to view more details. A summary of the podcast's topic, ratings, genre, and other information is included in the additional details. The most recent episode of that podcast should be the one that appears at the top. Earlier episodes can be listened to by scrolling down and selecting the one you want to hear.

You can choose to subscribe or unfollow the podcast you're listening to. By subscribing to a podcast, you can stay updated on new content and forthcoming episodes.
