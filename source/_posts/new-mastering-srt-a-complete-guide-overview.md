![launch textedit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/everything-you-should-know-about-srt-1.jpg)

Step2 Now, type 1 to indicate the beginning of the first caption sequence. Then click on ‘Enter’ on your Keyboard.

Enter of the following formats as the beginning and ending timecode; hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds – -> hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds

Step3 Move to the next line and start typing your caption. It's recommended you limit each caption to 32 characters and each line should contain only 2 captions. This makes it easier for viewers to read the captions with no rush. Plus, it ensures your subtitle text complies with legal guidelines.

Step4 After you've written the first caption, Click Enter twice and remember to always leave a blank line to indicate a new caption sequence.

Step5 Repeat step 3 & 4 until you've completed the Transcript. Make sure you check no errors in the spellings used in your captions.
