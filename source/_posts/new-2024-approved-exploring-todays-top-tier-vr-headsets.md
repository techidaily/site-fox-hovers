Because it is the best product in the market for VR experience it is also very expensive.

### Oculus Rift

Traditional game controllers are very much limited to a static virtual reality experience as compared to the Rift. Proper hand tracking is required to enjoy the immerse feel of the Rift.

### Microsoft HoloLens

### META 2
