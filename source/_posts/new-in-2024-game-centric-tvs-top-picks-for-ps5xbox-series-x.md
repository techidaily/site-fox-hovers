PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have proved to be excellent 4K gaming consoles, but to maximize the experience, you'll also need a high-quality gaming TV. You can play games on almost any TV, but would you rather get an experience built around 4K 120Hz games with HDR colors?

A good gaming TV should deliver a clear 4K picture with best-in-class black levels and the brightest highlights, along with spectacular color.
