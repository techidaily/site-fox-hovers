One of the main reasons users find it so useful is the ability to customize the video editing process by adding different kinds of plugins to the program.

## Conclusion

The good news is that After Effects allows for the use of plugins developed by third-party developers and some of the them like the text plugins, we have listed above can be very useful to a video’s production.
