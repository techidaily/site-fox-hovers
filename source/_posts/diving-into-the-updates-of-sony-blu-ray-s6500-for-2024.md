The well designed dual core processor makes its operating speed faster enough whereas the Quick Start Mode assists in efficient boots so that player can start within less than half second. Note that, Quick Start mode uses more power in standby whenever it is activated. Disc loading response is also faster where your Blu-Ray player takes only 15 to 20 seconds to get started. When test was conducted on its picture quality then most of the movies were played well with fine details of every scene. This deck performs a great job for colour adjustments on screen whereas camera pans and moving objects use to be smooth. Sony BDP-S6500 can also accommodate low video quality content with ease due to its upscaling capability.
