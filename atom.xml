We capture multiple images of the same subject or a scene with slightly different exposure and then mix all the images into a final perfect photograph.</p><p>A portrait is one of the most liked genres of photography, especially on the occasions of weddings, get-togethers, meet-ups, and many more. A good portrait photograph can capture a person’s detailed personality and emotions.</p><p>The camera can perform fantastic functions, but it is still a machine at the end of the day, and its sensors have limitations. But by the HDR technique, you can create a scene closer to what the human eye sees.</p><p>In this article, you’ll learn how to shoot and create impressive HDR portraits, whether a beginner or a professional. We have written about creating both still and moving HDR portraits in an easy way.</p><p>People often find it challenging to shoot a perfect HDR photograph from a phone camera. In this tutorial, we will answer some common questions on how to create an impressive HDR portrait. So let’s get started.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Still HDR Portraits</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Some Useful Tips to Remember</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">HDR Effects on Phone Camera</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">Moving HDR Portraits?</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Edit and Merge Images to Create an HDR Portrait?</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="How-to-Shoot-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#How-to-Shoot-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="How to Shoot HDR Portraits?"></a>How to Shoot HDR Portraits?</h2><p>HDR portraits are best captured when your subject is still and the camera is also fixed on a tripod. So first, we will talk about how to shoot still portraits and then moving portraits.</p><h3 id="Still-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#Still-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Still HDR Portraits"></a>Still HDR Portraits</h3><p>You can create a high-quality HDR portrait by following these simple steps.</p><h5 id="Step1Camera-Setting"><a href="#Step1Camera-Setting" class="headerlink" title="Step1Camera Setting"></a>Step1Camera Setting</h5><p>The first and most crucial part of your camera setting is to choose between two modes, i.e., manual or aperture mode. We have compared these two below so you can choose whichever way fits your situation.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Manual mode</strong></th><th><strong>Aperture Mode</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>In manual mode, you can control both aperture and shutter speed and select any desired value.</td><td>In this mode, you just have to select your desired aperture value, like <em>f</em>&#x2F;2.0 or <em>f</em>&#x2F;1.8, and the camera will automatically pick the suitable shutter speed.</td></tr><tr><td>It can be used when the lighting conditions are intense and constant, and you have plenty of time to think and adjust the exposure.</td><td>Useful when the light conditions are changing rapidly. It selects the best suitable exposure itself and has the advantage of speed.</td></tr><tr><td>You have more control over your camera settings.</td><td>The camera itself matches the aperture value with the appropriate shutter speed.</td></tr><tr><td>Suitable for professionals.</td><td>Suitable for beginners.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-1.jpg"                      alt="camera setting"                ></p><p>So it is your choice which mode you want to use. Both work perfectly with HDR photography.</p><h5 id="Step2Bracketing"><a href="#Step2Bracketing" class="headerlink" title="Step2Bracketing"></a>Step2Bracketing</h5><p>HDR photography uses the technique of bracketing in which multiple shots of the same subject are taken using different camera contrast settings and then merging these images to get a final result.</p><p>You can take numerous pictures manually by selecting a new exposure after every photo. Still, it is very time-consuming, and the chances of the subject moving during the shoot also increase.</p><p>So almost all DSLRs come with this beneficial feature of bracketing. You can check the user manual of your device to activate this feature. For some devices, it is started by a single click, while in some, it is hidden deep in the menu. Once you start it, you have to select the number of images you want to take and the increase in exposure after every snap.</p><p>Usually, three shots are ideal for HDR portraits as the chances of moving decrease. Nowadays, many latest DSLRs have the option of automatic exposure bracketing as it provides the photographer with different levels of exposure in a single click without spending valuable time adjusting camera settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-2.jpg"                      alt="moving decrease"                ></p><p>Once you are done with your bracketing settings, all you have to do is press and hold the shutter, and your specified number of photos will be taken, each with a different exposure value.</p><h3 id="Some-Useful-Tips-to-Remember"><a href="#Some-Useful-Tips-to-Remember" class="headerlink" title="Some Useful Tips to Remember"></a>Some Useful Tips to Remember</h3><ol><li><strong>Try to Keep the Subject Still</strong></li></ol><p>HDR portrait shooting takes time as you have to take 3-5 images of your subject. So you have to keep your subject still in every frame; otherwise, your final image will not be good.</p><p>To avoid moving, you can give them some support to lean on, like a wall, or ask them to sit on a chair.</p><ol><li><strong>Avoid Shaking the Camera</strong></li></ol><p>Same is the case for your camera. You have to use a tripod stand to avoid camera shaking.</p><ol><li><strong>Autofocus should be OFF</strong></li></ol><p>You should adjust the focus manually instead of autofocus, as it may shift the focus accidentally while pressing the shutter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-3.jpg"                      alt="autofocus should be off"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluetties.sjv.io/c/5597632/2141688/17094" target="_top" id="2141688">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17094-2141688" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluetties.sjv.io/i/5597632/2141688/17094"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="HDR-Effects-on-Phone-Camera"><a href="#HDR-Effects-on-Phone-Camera" class="headerlink" title="HDR Effects on Phone Camera"></a>HDR Effects on Phone Camera</h3><p>Of course, everyone can’t use a DSLR camera for shooting HDR portraits as the process is a bit difficult and requires some expertise. But you can achieve the same effects on your mobile phone. Many latest mobiles offer HDR features in their camera. Unlike the bracketing effect of professional cameras, mobile usually takes only one picture and then you can edit by using some third-party app. Hundreds of these photo editing apps allow you to change the brightness and contrast of your image to create a <em>“pseudo”</em> HDR image.</p><p>Now that you know how to shoot still HDR portraits, let’s put some light on shooting HDR moving portraits.</p><h3 id="Moving-HDR-Portraits"><a href="#Moving-HDR-Portraits" class="headerlink" title="Moving HDR Portraits?"></a>Moving HDR Portraits?</h3><p>People usually ask, “ <em>Can I shoot moving subjects in HDR?</em>“ or “<em>What is the basic method to get sharp-looking HDR photos of moving people?</em>“</p><p>Shooting moving portraits in HDR can get a bit difficult because of blurring and exposure issues. But you don’t need to worry because here are some of the effective solutions for recording moving HDR portraits.</p><p><strong>Solution 1.</strong> You can use two DSLRs with the same lens and set them so that the difference in the viewing angle is minimum.</p><p><strong>Solution 2.</strong> Using RAW files you can get a dynamic range of exposures that you wouldn’t be able to get with a JPEG file.</p><p><strong>Solution 3.</strong> DSLRs with high-quality exposure and depth sensors can also help shoot HDR moving portraits.</p><h2 id="How-to-Edit-and-Merge-Images-to-Create-an-HDR-Portrait"><a href="#How-to-Edit-and-Merge-Images-to-Create-an-HDR-Portrait" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit and Merge Images to Create an HDR Portrait?"></a>How to Edit and Merge Images to Create an HDR Portrait?</h2><p>After you have shot the images, the next step is to merge and edit them on photoshop or any other software to create a single perfect portrait.</p><h5 id="Step1Merging-the-Images"><a href="#Step1Merging-the-Images" class="headerlink" title="Step1Merging the Images"></a>Step1Merging the Images</h5><p>Hundreds of editing software are available but here we are going to talk about photoshop as it is used worldwide and is user-friendly.</p><ul><li>First, when you open Photoshop, go to <strong>Files &gt;</strong> <strong>Automate &gt; Merge to HDR pro,</strong> Or click on <strong>Tools &gt; Photoshop &gt; Merge to HDR pro</strong></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-4.jpg"                      alt="tools photoshop merge to hdr pro"                ></p><ul><li>Click on <strong>Browse</strong> and select the images you want to merge.</li><li>Before clicking the OK button, you can tick on the <strong>Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images</strong> option so that minor artifacts introduced while shooting the images can be removed by photoshop.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-5.jpg"                      alt="removed by photoshop"                ></p><ul><li>After the images are loaded, a dialogue box will appear on the right side with all the tools you need to edit your HDR portrait.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-and-create-impressive-hdr-portraits-6.jpg"                      alt="edit hdr portrait"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123732/7443" target="_top" id="2123732">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123732" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123732/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>Tick on the option of <strong>Remove ghosts</strong> to avoid any halos in the editing process.</li><li>For regular HDR portraits, select <strong>16 Bit</strong> mode in the first section.</li><li>The second section is <strong>Edge Glow</strong>.

There are so many things to consider when it comes to what makes good background music. What’s the tone of your content, and who is the audience?</p><p>Consider if you are a Product reviewer or explainer use subtle music to maintain the attention of your viewer to the information and product demo. If you are action Vlogger or doing daily lifestyle Vlog, use clear music to explain and advance the plot.</p><p>Remember choose music that speaks to your audience, the more you know about your audience’s age, affiliations, and preferences, the more specific you can be about your music choice. If your viewers cover wide swath of professionals in business, it’s best to play it safe with corporate tones. Classic rock, and ambient music. But if you know that they’re younger hip hop and dance music might be more appropriate.</p><p>Editing Software the has Royalty-free stock music</p><p>Background music is the bridge that allows the video to transition smoothly between different ideas or scenes, especially when you have a jump cut</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068407/7443" target="_top" id="2068407">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068407" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068407/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Editing-software-with-Royalty-free-background-music"><a href="#Editing-software-with-Royalty-free-background-music" class="headerlink" title="Editing software with Royalty-free background music"></a>Editing software with Royalty-free background music</h2><p>Video editing is essential to all vloggers or content creator, you need to find a software that has license and won’t ruin your channel someday.

Autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) sufferers report the sensation as extremely calming, with a static feeling over the head, back of the neck, shoulders, and sometimes elsewhere in the body. People have likened it and connected it to the frisson or shivers many experiences while listening to music. On the other hand, ASMR is elicited by crisp or quiet noises, either alone or in combination with conservative movement or personal attention. Some ASMR-inducing films incorporate visual clues, which seem to influence the reactions of some individuals.</p><p>Whether you’ve used ASMR to help you sleep in the past or you love its potential advantages, it’s worth researching how it works and the best <strong>ASMR for sleep</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-1.jpg"                      alt="asmr for sleep"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Why-does-ASMR-help-you-sleep"><a href="#Part-1-Why-does-ASMR-help-you-sleep" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why does ASMR help you sleep?"></a>Part 1: Why does ASMR help you sleep?</h2><p>Due to the recent discovery of <strong>ASMR sleep videos</strong>, research into its mechanism is still in its infancy. Researchers have assumptions about how ASMR works, and the conducted research gives fascinating data.</p><p>Researchers did <a class="link"   href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6209833/" >fMRI brain scans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on participants experiencing ASMR in one investigation. During the ASMR tingle, participants in the research demonstrated activity across their brains, known as whole brain activation. There was also intense activity in the brain region involved with self-awareness, social comprehension, and social movements in nonhuman primates, including grooming behaviors. Because the effects of <strong>ASMR for sleep</strong> are comparable to those of social grooming in monkeys, the researchers hypothesized that it might be a grooming response that survived evolution.</p><p>So, <strong>does ASMR help you sleep</strong>? Let us find the answer in the subsequent paragraphs.</p><p>ASMR is a social reaction, which explains why it increases feelings of comfort, relaxation, and drowsiness. ASMR engages brain parts connected with chemicals such as dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins, which may boost these experiences. It may also explain why some personality traits, particularly openness to new experiences, seem to enhance the likelihood of someone having ASMR.</p><p>ASMR, on the other hand, maybe more sophisticated than this idea predicts. While most individuals who experience ASMR find it calming, it also tends to cause heightened excitement and non-sexual physiological arousal. Nostalgia is a complicated experience that could be both pleasant and sad, and ASMR may be a complex reaction that is both relaxing and exciting. ASMR links with brain connectivity. According to one research, persons with it have diminished functional connectivity or a typical connection in particular brain parts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-2.jpg"                      alt="asmr help you sleep"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043639/7443" target="_top" id="2043639">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043639" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043639/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Best-ASMR-Channels-for-Sleep"><a href="#Part-2-Best-ASMR-Channels-for-Sleep" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best ASMR Channels for Sleep"></a>Part 2: Best ASMR Channels for Sleep</h2><p>Although not everyone, most individuals tend to experience ASMR for the first time between the ages of 5 and 10, though some people experience it later in life.

Even silent phone vibrations might disrupt sleep. (30 dB might interrupt sleep) Even if you don’t wake up, it may create a lighter sleep period, leaving you unrested. Before bed, set “do not disturb.” During the stated time, it mutes calls, emails, and notifications—no ringing or buzzing. The content continues without warning. In an emergency, you may customize the mode to accept specific calls.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-8.jpg"                      alt="turn off notification"                ></p><h3 id="2-Turn-off-YouTube-autoplay"><a href="#2-Turn-off-YouTube-autoplay" class="headerlink" title="2.

When you turn on autoplay, the following relevant video in the playlist will begin playing automatically when the previous video finishes playing. It continues playing videos, so you don’t have to choose a new video to view once the one you’re watching stops playing. To maximize <strong>ASMR sleep</strong>, you can switch off autoplay and avoid the discomfort of having to search for the back button to halt unwanted music frantically.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/asmr-for-sleep-9.jpg"                      alt="turn off youtube auto play"                ></p><h3 id="3-Stop-finding-the-best-sleeping-position-and-focus-on-the-ASMR"><a href="#3-Stop-finding-the-best-sleeping-position-and-focus-on-the-ASMR" class="headerlink" title="3.

This can be done using various devices, such as smart gloves, often known as data gloves.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss <strong>Hand Tracking</strong> technology, its various applications, and how to create it using Python, OpenCV, and Media Pipe.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Tracking With Interface</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Tracking Without Interface</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">What is OpenCV</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">What Is Media Pipe</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Guidance With Steps</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Use Filmora to demonstarte your Hand Tracking skill</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking"></a>Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.</p><p>There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:</p><ol><li><strong>Palm Detection</strong>: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.</li><li><strong>Hand Landmarks Identification</strong>: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/20-hand-landmarks-for-identifiction-hand-tracking.jpg"                      alt="20 hand landmarks for identifiction – hand tracking"                ></p><h3 id="Guidance-With-Steps"><a href="#Guidance-With-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Guidance With Steps"></a>Guidance With Steps</h3><p>Before starting to create Hand Tracking, you need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" >Pycharm IDE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>app on your PC.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Optimizing-Zoom-Videos-Essential-3-Part-Methodology"><a href="#Optimizing-Zoom-Videos-Essential-3-Part-Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Optimizing Zoom Videos: Essential 3-Part Methodology"></a>Optimizing Zoom Videos: Essential 3-Part Methodology</h2><p>Today, face-to-face contact is severely constrained in modern society, making the zoom for pc download quite helpful. One of its finest features is the ability to record meetings in order to capture every moment as a video. Using the Zoom app requires understanding how to convert ZOOM recordings to MP4 video format for free online. Zoom is a really practical technology that, as you undoubtedly well know, enables individuals to continue working or attending school despite the epidemic. If you have a Zoom recording, you undoubtedly have questions about how to get to the videos. Additionally, you must convert your Zoom recordings to mp4 if you detect that they are an unknown file format. However, Zoom recordings are immediately saved to your PC in MP4 format. However, sometimes the conversion is unsuccessful, leaving you with .Zoom files for your recordings. In this situation, you must convert the zoom recording to MP4.</p><p>One of its most intriguing features is the ability to record meetings in order to save every event as a film. One of the most important aspects of utilizing the Zoom app is learning how to convert a ZOOM video recording format to MP4 for free online. Zoom is a tool or software that enables several users to participate in a videoconference. It operates through meetings that attempt to replicate many of the activities we may perform at a meeting in person of any sort. Zoom allows you to record meetings, and after the meeting is over, it will begin to convert the recording to MP4. But a number of factors might lead this phase to fail. You may be wondering, “How do I convert a Zoom recording to MP4?” when you encounter the Zoom failed to convert recording problem. Thankfully, it’s a rather straightforward procedure that doesn’t need for any additional software. This article will demonstrate three different approaches for converting Zoom recordings to MP4 files. However, you must be the host of the meeting or have authorization to record it.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Way-1-Convert-the-Local-Recording-in-Zoom-App"><a href="#Way-1-Convert-the-Local-Recording-in-Zoom-App" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Convert the Local Recording in Zoom App"></a>Way 1. Convert the Local Recording in Zoom App</h2><p>Zoom provides both local and cloud recording options. Users of the former may capture meeting video and audio thanks to its availability to both free and paid members. The latter allows paying subscribers to audio, video, and text-record the conference. Additionally, the recording file formats include TXT, MP4, and M4A. At the conclusion of a meeting, Zoom automatically transforms the raw video to an mp4 file. However, the video will be stored as a .zoom file if the operation is aborted. A.mp4 file that is an MP4 contains both audio and video data. M4A only has audio files in it. All MP4 files may be played using the M3U playlist file. Additionally, meeting chat conversations are saved in a TXT file.</p><h5 id="Step1Create-the-Recording"><a href="#Step1Create-the-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step1Create the Recording"></a>Step1Create the Recording</h5><p>The recording must first be made by entering the Zoom meeting and selecting Record. Zoom gives you the option of either PC storage or cloud storage for the recordings. Both choices offer advantages and disadvantages. You should convert the files into mp4 if you want to save them on your computer since they are smaller without sacrificing quality and take up less space. You will need a Zoom account to store the files if you decide to use cloud storage.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/use-zoom-video-converter-1.jpg"                      alt="create the recording"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Download-the-Recording"><a href="#Step2Download-the-Recording" class="headerlink" title="Step2Download the Recording"></a>Step2Download the Recording</h5><p>By accessing the Zoom folder in your computer’s Documents folder, you may quickly locate your Zoom recordings.

As a result, you are unable to record meetings anytime you want. A screen recording program from a third party, like Filmora from Wondershare, is the greatest answer to these issues. This professional program for Windows and Mac comes with a screen recording capability that enables you to record your screen activity in excellent definition, including zoom calls. Additionally, you have a variety of customizable recording options, including picture-in-picture, output format, frame rate, and quality.</p><p>The default Zoom recording is made in poor quality and offers no customizing options. Additionally, in order to record the meeting as a participant, you must have the host’s consent. MP4 is the ideal file type for saving Zoom meetings. This is due to the great compatibility of the MP4 format with a variety of hardware and media players. The MP4 format also provides high quality while being somewhat modest in size. Use Wondershare Filmora to get over these problems and capture Zoom meetings in excellent definition. The captured video may be transferred, compressed, and given further editing as required with this program.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>Steps to Record Zoom and Export the Video as Mp4 Format</strong></p><h5 id="Step1Download-and-Install-Filmora"><a href="#Step1Download-and-Install-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step1Download and Install Filmora"></a>Step1Download and Install <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h5><p>In the first step, visit the official website to download the latest version of Filmora for your PC.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Inverted-Images-Conundrum-on-Instagram-Feed"><a href="#The-Inverted-Images-Conundrum-on-Instagram-Feed" class="headerlink" title="The Inverted Images Conundrum on Instagram Feed"></a>The Inverted Images Conundrum on Instagram Feed</h2><p>Are you worried that your video on Instagram is sideways?</p><p>There are a few possible reasons why your Instagram video is sideways. One option is that you uploaded the video with the wrong rotation. Another possibility is that you took the video with your phone’s camera in the wrong orientation. Finally, Instagram may not have been able to detect the proper orientation of the video, causing it to be shown sideways.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-does-Instagram-keep-flipping-my-video"><a href="#Why-does-Instagram-keep-flipping-my-video" class="headerlink" title="Why does Instagram keep flipping my video?"></a>Why does Instagram keep flipping my video?</h2><p>Because Instagram is built to display videos in landscape mode, it may be flipping your videos sideways. This indicates the video will be rotated to be wider than it is tall, which is the standard video orientation.</p><p>So, when you post a vertical video to Instagram Stories from your camera roll, it is automatically cropped to a 9:16 aspect ratio. Because your phone camera didn’t automatically alter the orientation before you started filming, films filmed horizontally can sometimes be posted sideways.</p><h2 id="How-to-rotate-videos-for-Instagram"><a href="#How-to-rotate-videos-for-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="How to rotate videos for Instagram?"></a>How to rotate videos for Instagram?</h2><p>Individuals currently choose to capture films utilizing high-resolution cameras rather than large video cameras on mobile devices. However, you may overlook the video’s orientation, resulting in a completely reversed recording.</p><p>Don’t be alarmed! You can easily restore the video to its original state using various free programs (instead of turning your neck to watch the video). Here are a few basic tools for rotating, flipping, and turning your videos (both software and web-based options).</p><p>Many applications and softwares can be used to rotate videoes, but among all of them, Filmora is one of the highly recommended software.</p><h3 id="1-Filmora"><a href="#1-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="1. Filmora"></a>1. Filmora</h3><p>In Filmora, you can rotate your movie to whatever angle you choose. You may also quickly zoom in or crop out the video parts that you don’t want to watch. Predefined aspect ratios such as 16:9, 9:16, 4:5, 1:1, and others are also included to assist you in easily finding the best aspect ratio for YouTube, Instagram, and other sites. But, first, let’s look at how to change a video’s orientation in Filmora.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the video</strong></p><p>Launch Filmora and drag the video onto the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-turns-video-sideway-1.jpg"                      alt="instagram-turns-video-sideway-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Rotate the video</strong></p><p>Double-click the video clip on the timeline to open the video editing window. Under the “Transform” menu, look for the “Rotate” option. You can change the rotation value by sliding the slider or entering a certain value. It is possible to rotate up to 360o. For example, if you want to rotate this clip 90 degrees, write “90” in the box, and the video clip will be rotated.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-turns-video-sideway-2.jpg"                      alt="instagram-turns-video-sideway-"                ></p><p>By dragging the “Scale” button, you can make the image a full screen or alter the position, size, shape, and other aspects of the image directly in the Viewer panel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-turns-video-sideway-3.jpg"                      alt="instagram-turns-video-sideway-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Export the video</strong></p><p>When you’re happy, click export. You can alter the format of your work right here, or you can upload it to YouTube.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-turns-video-sideway-4.jpg"                      alt="instagram-turns-video-sideway-"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896555/19272" target="_top" id="1896555">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896555" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896555/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Veed-io"><a href="#2-Veed-io" class="headerlink" title="2.

It’s free to use, and the instructions for rotating video clips are straightforward.

You can also record a new video or use other upload mechanisms like Dropbox or a YouTube URL using VEED.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-turns-video-sideway-5.jpg"                      alt="instagram-turns-video-sideway-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Rotate the video:</strong></p><p>Allow time for the upload to complete. The rotating button will display above the image when you click it. To change the direction of your movie, drag this button. Under the ‘Adjust’ menu, you may also write the exact rotation angle.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-turns-video-sideway-6.jpg"                      alt="instagram-turns-video-sideway-"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Export the rotated video:</strong></p><p>The rotating video will be saved when you click ‘Export,’ which you may publish to your Instagram feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-turns-video-sideway-7.jpg"                      alt="instagram-turns-video-sideway-"                ></p><p>You can download your video in a variety of resolutions, including Standard, HD, 4K, Super-8, and Cinematic.</p><p>Other video resolutions that you can export are Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube (4K, 1440P, 1080P, and 720P) video resolutions, which already contain the right settings — like file size and frames per second — for each site, so you don’t have to fiddle with the details.</p><h3 id="3-Movavi-Clips"><a href="#3-Movavi-Clips" class="headerlink" title="3.

Zoom In&#x2F;Out with Keyboard Shortcut"></a>Way 1. Zoom In&#x2F;Out with Keyboard Shortcut</h2><p>You’ve been looking at your screen nonstop, but you can’t figure out what it says. You could find the answer you’re searching for by zooming in on your computer. The majority of simple tasks may be performed with the keyboard, such as moving an item using the W, A, S, and D keys, but you can rotate the environment or zoom in and out using the trackpad. By the way, you may move the game’s camera by using the navigation buttons. For instance, in the Roblox game, the numerical keys on the keyboard may be used to modify the objects’ seating positions as well as the weapons and equipment they are carrying. And don’t worry, zooming in and out is not a difficult task. You really have a wide variety of methods to zoom in and out of your Roblox PC depending on your preferences.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Keyboard:</strong></p><p>Step1To start playing, you must first sign into Roblox using your browser. Go to the Roblox website in your favourite web browser by opening it. Start a testing game session after logging in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/login-to-roblox-site.jpg"                      alt="login to roblox site"                ></p><p>Step2Now, all you have to do to zoom in is hit the ‘I’ key on your keyboard, which is located between the ‘U’ and ‘O’ keys.</p><p>Step3If you press or hold this, you’ll probably enter first-person perspective, where you can’t zoom in any more. If you’re already somewhat out of focus, however, you’ll first zoom in toward your character before entering first-person view.</p><p>Step4Simply press the ‘O’ key on your keyboard (the letter between ‘P’ and ‘I’ on a QWERTY keyboard) to zoom out. You may hit “O” as many as you wish or hold it down while you do so to increase the zoom to its highest setting.</p><p>Step5To get the playing zoom level you desire, press “I” and “O” together. You must consequently mix the actions of these two keyboard keys in order to zoom in at the most pleasing scale.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Zoom-In-Out-in-Roblox-with-Mouse-Control"><a href="#Way-2-Zoom-In-Out-in-Roblox-with-Mouse-Control" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Zoom In&#x2F;Out in Roblox with Mouse Control"></a>Way 2. Zoom In&#x2F;Out in Roblox with Mouse Control</h2><p>With over half of all Roblox users being under the age of 16, it is likely that you already know the mouse zooming method. Roblox is one of the most well-known gaming and playing networks for youngsters. To move the camera in all directions, hold down the right mouse button or right mouse click. This control is available in all of Roblox’s games. If your mouse is compatible, you can enable Smart Zoom in the Mouse Preferences and zoom with only a single finger double-tap. You may choose other zoom settings, such as whether to zoom the whole screen or only a portion of it. But you must do certain actions in order to change the camera and mouse sensitivity.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Mouse</strong></p><p>Step1Go to the Roblox website in your favourite web browser by opening it. Start a testing game session after logging in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/start-testing-game-session-roblox.jpg"                      alt="start testing game session roblox"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2126492/26400" target="_top" id="2126492">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2126492" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2126492/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2Once your gaming session has begun, you may zoom by using the wheel while moving ahead. Once again, if you scroll all the way down, this action will put you in first person perspective. Now all you have to do is use your cursor to scroll ahead to zoom in.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-with-cursoe-scroll.jpg"                      alt="zoom in with cursoe scroll"                ></p><p>Step3When the game’s map is in your field of vision and you reach the maximum zoom level, just scroll backward with your mouse to zoom out. It will be essential to do the opposite operation, namely scroll the other direction, to zoom out on your character, in order to zoom in.</p><p>Step4In order to play at your selected zoom level, scroll backwards and forth. Because your character will be presented in such tiny type, it will be challenging to play comfortably and see it clearly. Therefore, maintaining balance is crucial in order to have the zoom adjusted to your preferred playing style.</p><h2 id="Way-3-Use-Xbox-Controller-Thumbsticks-to-Zoom"><a href="#Way-3-Use-Xbox-Controller-Thumbsticks-to-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Way 3.

Use Xbox Controller Thumbsticks to Zoom</h2><p>The amount of mouse usage varies greatly depending on the kind of game being played, with racing games requiring the least amount of mouse use and first-person shooter games requiring the most. Nevertheless, there are several methods to play every game without a mouse. Since the Roblox platform makes it possible to create games, the game’s creator mostly determines the control parameters. In such scenario, you also need a trackpad since using the keyboard could prevent you from accessing some menu options. The good news for Xbox players is that you may do so by using the Thumb sticks.</p><p><strong>Steps to Zoom in on Roblox with Xbox Controller:</strong></p><p>Step1There is a simple and convenient technique to manage the zoom while playing Roblox on the Xbox. Push the R3 button on your controller, which corresponds to the right stick click, to enable the zoom feature. Additionally, you may depress the right thumbstick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/push-r3-button-controller.jpg"                      alt="push r3 button ontroller"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137201/26400" target="_top" id="2137201">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137201" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137201/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step2Zoom in by pressing forward on the right thumbstick that has been clicked down.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/press-forward-right-thumbstick.jpg"                      alt="press forward right thumbstick"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037355/7443" target="_top" id="2037355">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037355" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037355/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3Pull rearward on the clicked-down right thumbstick to zoom out.

Time-lapse videos are ideal for quickly showing how things develop over a period and are often created when buildings are being constructed, projects are being worked or to show how a scene changes over the course of a day. There are many different apps that you can download to your iPhone to obtain exceptional time-lapse video footage, with effects including Loop, Bounce and Long Exposure.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part1: How to record time-lapse video</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part2: What you need to know before you begin</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part3: Recommended third-party app</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part1-How-to-record-time-lapse-video"><a href="#Part1-How-to-record-time-lapse-video" class="headerlink" title="Part1: How to record time-lapse video"></a>Part1: How to record time-lapse video</h2><p>If you wish to record time-lapse video on your iPhone, you will need the most recent version of iOS. For best results and a higher-resolution, use a modern iPhone as these can even offer 4K video at a maximum of 30 frames-per-second. Here are the steps you need to take to get started.</p><ul><li>Open the iPhone Camera app, swiping right or down to get to the Time-Lapse section.</li><li>Tap the Record button to begin recording your video</li><li>Tap again to stop and save the video.</li><li>To find your video, head to the Photos app’s Recently Added, Camera Roll or Video sections.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/time-lapse-iphone.jpg"                      alt="time lapse"                ></p><h2 id="Part2-What-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin"><a href="#Part2-What-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin" class="headerlink" title="Part2: What you need to know before you begin"></a>Part2: What you need to know before you begin</h2><p><strong>Shorter time -</strong> It’s usually best to shoot for a long period of time to get the best results. The footage you obtain will be much shorter than the length of time you are shooting for, which means you will need to remain patient to get the best results. You can usually get around 40 seconds of time-lapse footage from a 10-minute session, which means you would need to shoot for around an hour to make a four-minute clip. The reason for this is that the footage is played at a specific number of frames per second, which is substantially more frames than the app you will be using can capture. The number of frames taken per second will depend not only on the app you are using but the settings you choose too.</p><p><strong>Be stable -</strong> Your iPhone also needs to remain as stable as possible so you can prevent camera from motioning and jittering and avoid compromising the quality of the results. If you are able to use a tripod or stand rather than holding your device in your hand, this will be very helpful. Don’t forget to lock the focus, exposure or both before you start recording. You also need to ensure that your iPhone has enough storage space to capture and hold your video. Time-lapse videos can be data-heavy due to the way the feature uses a large buffer and video cache. This is especially important if you are shooting in hi-resolution.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123512" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part3-Recommended-third-party-app"><a href="#Part3-Recommended-third-party-app" class="headerlink" title="Part3: Recommended third-party app"></a>Part3: Recommended third-party app</h2><p>Though you may find the time-lapse functionality on the iPhone camera satisfactory, you can get much better results by downloading a third-party app. Here are two of the most popular iPhone apps on the market for capturing time-lapse footage.</p><h4 id="1-Lapse-It"><a href="#1-Lapse-It" class="headerlink" title="1.

You can understand!! So far, there is no clear surface but the game developers and designers are trying their best to solve problems by their own. They are sharing their lessons that they have learned while developing first several VR games. Some of the concerns that they are sharing are – interaction patterns, reality-trade-off and fidelity contract in terms of physics rule, affordance and narrative expectations.</p><p> It is quite expected that in future, more and more best practices will converge together with even more advanced research in VR psychology and UX. Hopefully soon this will cause the emergence of some conventions that will put the developers, designers and the players on the same page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-market.jpg"                      alt=" vr-market"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2002018/7443" target="_top" id="2002018">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2002018" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2002018/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037334/7443" target="_top" id="2037334">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037334" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037334/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-premier-selections-versatile-and-affordable-macpc-bd-decoders/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Premier Selections Versatile and Affordable Mac/PC BD Decoders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-ideal-fps-levels-in-slow-motion-cinema/"><u>[New] Ideal FPS Levels in Slow Motion Cinema</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-enhancing-films-with-effective-b-roll-usage-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Enhancing Films with Effective B-Roll Usage for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-building-brands-and-bonds-on-instagram-steps-to-reach-a-thousand-followers/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Building Brands and Bonds on Instagram Steps to Reach a Thousand Followers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-sketch-like-a-pro-top-10-drawing-apps-for-android-artists-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Sketch Like a Pro Top 10 Drawing Apps for Android Artists for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/updated-what-are-the-best-websites-to-download-amusing-and-funny-ringtones/"><u>[Updated] What Are the Best Websites to Download Amusing and Funny Ringtones?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/2024-approved-5-simple-tricks-for-aspiring-photoshop-editors/"><u>2024 Approved 5 Simple Tricks for Aspiring Photoshop Editors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-expert-advice-on-screen-casting-in-google-meet/"><u>2024 Approved Expert Advice on Screen Casting in Google Meet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-master-premiere-pros-art-free-template-pack-2023/"><u>2024 Approved Master Premiere Pro's Art Free Template Pack 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/3-solutions-to-hard-reset-honor-v-purse-phone-using-pc-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>3 Solutions to Hard Reset Honor V Purse Phone Using PC | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-vivo-y100i-power-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Vivo Y100i Power 5G?

Compared with other 360-degree cameras, it’s shape is very unique and crashproof. Below are the complete specs, pros and cons, reviews and suggestions about Giroptic 360cam, hope these can give you a reference if you want to buy a 360-degree camera.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 5 360 Degree Action Cameras &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1:Complete Review</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2:Pros and Cons at a glance</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3:Basic specs</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4:Should I buy</a></li></ul><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Complete-Review-of-Giroptic-360cam"><a href="#Part-1-Complete-Review-of-Giroptic-360cam" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Complete Review of Giroptic 360cam"></a>Part 1: Complete Review of Giroptic 360cam</h2><p> <strong>Brief introduction</strong></p><p> Giroptic 360cam is the first consumer-ready camera that was born out of a Kickstarter campaign two years ago that brought in $ 1.4 million of crowdfunding. With access to this affordable full HD camera one no longer needs expensive camera rigs and post-processing software to create 360 degree images or videos with Virtual Reality (VR) experience. Armed with three equidistant optical lenses and three microphones, it records full spherical videos and high quality JPEG images that can be shared via your smartphone or computers without any extra software.</p><p> <strong>Design</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/giroptic-360cam-details.png"                      alt="Giroptic Design"                ></p><p> The funky pear or egg shaped design of Giroptic 360cam not only makes it totally compact and compatible to all kinds of environments and uses but also quite unique in the market. While the top houses the lenses, the bottom third of the body is detachable and holds that battery and the micro-SD card. The tripod mount and the Ethernet port are also located at the bottom of the camera. The black rubber coating makes it extremely suitable for rugged use and also water-resistant; it can survive up to 30 feet deep underwater for 30 minutes.</p><p> <strong>How to use it</strong></p><p> Operating Giroptic is very easy as it is essentially one-button process. You only need to press once to record, once to stop; leave the stitching and processing of the frames to your camera. The stitched videos&#x2F;images will be automatically ready to be uploaded to social sites.</p><p> Apart from the button to start&#x2F;stop recording, there’s another small button in the camera that lets you switch between different shooting modes like Video, Photo, Burst and Timelapse.</p><p> It uses a small LED display to show you the current shooting mode and the power level of the camera.</p><p> An inbuilt adaptor allows you to look at photos as soon as you take them and decide whether to delete the unwanted photos.</p><p> <strong>Where to use Giroptic 360cam</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/giroptic-360cam-where-to-use.JPG"                      alt="Giroptic- Where to use"                ></p><p> Giroptic 360cam is capable of functioning as a good surveillance camera in your home or workspace. This smart camera can be the diligent record-keeper of all your important business meetings, travels, memorable gathering of family and friends or any sports event.</p><p> <strong>Video and Image Quality</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/giroptic-360-cam-image-quality.jpg"                      alt="Giroptic- image quality"                ></p><p> The camera can capture 4K photos at up to three shots per second and record 2K videos at 30 frames per second. However, its maker Ollier admits that Giroptic 360cam can’t compete with high-end professional 360 cams of Nikon or GoPro. The 2K videos created by the camera have slightly visible stitching lines. However, the sophisticated digital stabilization technology used in the camera ensures that the processed footages run smooth and look good. For amateur shooting purposes, it is no doubt the best!</p><p> <strong>How to edit</strong></p><p> You don’t need any extra software or external accessory to process the captured images and videos and stitch them into single 360-degree spherical shot. Your Giroptic cam will do that automatically and make the stitched video file ready for social media sites like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram right in the camera itself. It is a smart gadget that knows which sites accept what file formats.</p><p> With the help of the Giroptic’s mobile app lets you can easily adjust a few settings, activate camera stabilization during a live feed.</p><p> The stitched photos and videos can be easily transferred to any device including smartphones, tablets, PCs and virtual reality headsets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/1186802/12108" target="_top" id="1186802">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-1186802" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/1186802/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Pros-and-Cons-of-Giroptic-360cam-at-a-glance"><a href="#Part-2-Pros-and-Cons-of-Giroptic-360cam-at-a-glance" class="headerlink" title="Part 2:Pros and Cons of Giroptic 360cam at a glance"></a>Part 2:Pros and Cons of Giroptic 360cam at a glance</h2><p> Giroptic 360cam provides you with a number of definite advantages over its competitors in the market.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Replaceable battery&#x2F;SD card</td><td>Video isn’t as detailed as that from other 360-degree cameras</td></tr><tr><td>Water-resistant</td><td>Has trouble stitching video</td></tr><tr><td>Light bulb and Ethernet accessories</td><td>Quite expensive</td></tr><tr><td>Takes true 360-degree images</td><td>Low video quality</td></tr><tr><td>Has an impressive storage space.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Live stream feature</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Rubberized skin.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Has a universal mount and micro USB port.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Its egg shaped design makes it compact and portable.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Shock and water resistant.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>360cam has native apps both for Android and iOS mobile devices.</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Stitching done in-camera</td><td>-</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2100537/7443" target="_top" id="2100537">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2100537" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2100537/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Basic-specs-of-Giroptic-360cam"><a href="#Part-3-Basic-specs-of-Giroptic-360cam" class="headerlink" title="Part 3:Basic specs of Giroptic 360cam"></a>Part 3:Basic specs of Giroptic 360cam</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Full name</th><th>Giroptic 360cam</th><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Price</td><td>Official: $499</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Basic specifications</strong></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Date Available</td><td>2016-05-24</td><td>Manufacturer</td><td>Giroptic</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>180g</td><td>Size</td><td>70x70x71 mm</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>internal standard SD card slot support is up to 128GB</td><td>Accessible</td><td>WIFI&#x2F;In-built GPS</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>Rechargeable Li-ion Battery 1180mAH, 3.7V up to 1 hour in video mode</td><td>Body material</td><td>Magnesium alloy and rubber</td></tr><tr><td>Sensor</td><td>custom-made CMOS sensors</td><td>Lenses</td><td>Three 185 degree fisheye lenses</td></tr><tr><td>Image resolution</td><td>Max 4096 x 2048</td><td>Video resolution</td><td>Max 2048 x 1024</td></tr><tr><td>Aspect Ratio</td><td>16:9</td><td>Tripod Mount</td><td>regular mount thread</td></tr><tr><td>Image format</td><td>JPEG</td><td>Video file format</td><td>Video file format</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043661/7443" target="_top" id="2043661">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043661" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043661/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Should-I-buy"><a href="#Part-4-Should-I-buy" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Should I buy"></a>Part 4: Should I buy</h2><p> Though the video quality is not as good as Kodak’s or 360fly’s, Giroptic 360cam is certainly a good HD cam which records true 360-degree images. It is also more compatible and works with more smartphone models than cameras like Samsung Gear 360. With its shock and water resistant features and the tough rubber coating on the body, it is certainly more durable than many other cameras in the market.

Being a photo text editor, you need to be careful about every element that is across the photo. Thus, to make your photos look perfect with the added text, you should be aware of the few tips that are featured below:</p><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-Perspective"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-Perspective" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the Perspective"></a>1. Understanding the Perspective</h3><p>Adding text as a perspective is believed to be an inclusive way of providing viewers with the idea of the image and helping them understand it to the fullest. If you are looking forward to writing a text on photos,you can give your text a little angle and appearance according to the image shoot for a good illusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-9.jpg"                      alt="understand image perspective"                ></p><h3 id="2-Blending-in-with-the-Photo’s-Properties"><a href="#2-Blending-in-with-the-Photo’s-Properties" class="headerlink" title="2. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties"></a>2. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties</h3><p>It is essential for you to figure out the right contrast of text that matches or immerses perfectly with the photo. This helps you ensure that the text of your photo stands out to the viewers with no affective disturbances. Not only will it look good, but it also won’t tamper with the quality of the photo that it holds across.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-10.jpg"                      alt=" blend text with image properties"                ></p><h3 id="3-Look-for-Negative-Space"><a href="#3-Look-for-Negative-Space" class="headerlink" title="3. Look for Negative Space"></a>3. Look for Negative Space</h3><p>When you consider adding text across a photo, it is highly advised that you should always go for an option that contains a general space for covering. Often referred to as negative space, utilizing that space for the text may be the perfect way that you can consider writing a text on photos. This puts no effect on the photo and helps the user display the whole idea with prominence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-11.jpg"                      alt="add text in negative space"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://versadesk.pxf.io/c/5597632/1815679/21290" target="_top" id="1815679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21290-1815679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://versadesk.pxf.io/i/5597632/1815679/21290"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Framing-the-Text"><a href="#4-Framing-the-Text" class="headerlink" title="4. Framing the Text"></a>4. Framing the Text</h3><p>If you go for prominence, you should always use elements that are meant for bringing prominence. Text that is to be highlighted with purity across a photo should be framed rather than any other tactful technique. This helps you create a clear focal point while sustaining the quality of the image. Following this, it also keeps a good view across the photo as a subjective associate picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-12.jpg"                      alt="frame the text"                ></p><h3 id="5-Control-your-Sizes-and-Styles"><a href="#5-Control-your-Sizes-and-Styles" class="headerlink" title="5. Control your Sizes and Styles"></a>5. Control your Sizes and Styles</h3><p>Make sure that you always select a font size or style that is relevant to the photo. The use of inappropriate sizes and styles in photos takes away the essence of the picture. A balance across these traits is essential for the user to bring. Capture the viewers’ attention without compromising the quality of the photo itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-13.jpg"                      alt="select accurate font size and style"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2139322/26400" target="_top" id="2139322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2139322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2139322/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The best illustration of images is not possible without adding typography to them.
