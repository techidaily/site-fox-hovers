    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Explore-ASMR’s-Impact-on-Stress-Reduction"><a href="#Explore-ASMR’s-Impact-on-Stress-Reduction" class="headerlink" title="Explore ASMR’s Impact on Stress Reduction"></a>Explore ASMR’s Impact on Stress Reduction</h2><p><strong>Why is ASMR relaxing</strong>? As the globe becomes connected, new trends and fads emerge regularly. One of these developments is Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), which has taken the world by storm in recent years. What began as a tiny community on sites such as YouTube has become a global sensation. Individuals of all ages (even celebrities!) are generating their own ASMR films on platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and others.</p><p>But just what is ASMR? The experience differs from individual to individual, but the fundamental notion is the tingling feeling individuals get when exposed to specific noises such as whispering, tapping, and others. So <strong>why do people like ASMR</strong>? Read on to know.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefit-of-asmr-1.png"                      alt="benefits of asmr"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Why-do-People-like-ASMR"><a href="#Part-1-Why-do-People-like-ASMR" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?"></a>Part 1: Why do People like ASMR?</h2><p>Some individuals experience ASMR in response to various sensory “triggers.” It may be listening to someone talk or tapping or seeing someone brush their hair or folding their clothing with care and precision. It could also be particular noises like tapping or whispering. In addition, one of the most common triggers in ordinary life is a light touch, such as caressing someone’s arm or tracing one’s fingers on the back.</p><p>Here are some fundamental reasons <strong>why people like ASMR</strong>:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefit-of-asmr-2.png"                      alt="why people like asmr"                ></p><ul><li><strong>ASMR helps one cope with Stress &amp; Anxiety:</strong> Studies fund that ASMR assists people in dealing with stress and anxiety. One <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2018/06/26/asmr-research-survey-affect-physiology/" >2018 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discovered that ASMR reduced stress, while another in 2017 discovered that 11% of individuals viewed ASMR videos mainly to assist them in coping with anxiety. Similarly, 2015 research found that 70% of its participants utilized ASMR films to cope with stress. It’s not just anecdotal evidence—research reveals that individuals who watch ASMR regularly report feeling happier and less stressed than those who don’t!</li><li><strong>It helps some people solve sleeping issues:</strong> If this is the case, you are not alone. Many individuals use ASMR as a sleep aid by many individuals. According to a <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2017/11/09/asmr-research-survey-personality-empathy-triggers/" >2017 study <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, 41% of individuals utilized ASMR to help them fall asleep. Another <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/" >2015 research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> discovered that 82 percent of the subjects used ASMR to fall asleep because the videos are low-stress and calming. Because they generally center on relaxing sounds or sights, viewing ASMR videos might help you unwind after a busy day and prepare for the night.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Why-is-ASMR-Relaxing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-is-ASMR-Relaxing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?"></a>Part 2: Why is ASMR Relaxing?</h2><p>Another pertinent query relating to the above section would be <strong>why ASMR is relaxing</strong>. Here is a detailed and factual answer.</p><p>ASMR is a sense of quiet, relaxation, and comfort from viewing particular videos that often show someone executing a delicate job, such as speaking or tapping on things. These films visibly improve people’s tranquillity and help them fall asleep quicker. They also establish a bond between the maker of the video and the viewer. You can trace this behavior back to ancient times when individuals would listen to others tell tales to feel comfortable and at peace.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefits-of-asmr-3.jpg"                      alt="why is asmr relaxing"                ></p><p>Giulia Poerio’s Hubbub public engagement work has included her <a class="link"   href="https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/28427/Bookshelf%5FNBK453230.pdf?sequence=1#page=123" >psychological research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR). The research stated that relaxing, tingling sensations begin at the top of the head and spread down the neck, spine, and sometimes throughout the rest of the body in response to specific triggers. According to this study, ASMR is fascinating, whether experienced or not. The sheer number of YouTube videos and accompanying viewership data show that it is far from a niche experience. According to anecdotal evidence, you can use ASMR as a sleep aid and a technique for increasing wellness.</p><p>People have even employed ASMR to assist them in curing their discomfort. While it requires further research to support this assertion, they conducted a study to keep it. In <a class="link"   href="https://asmruniversity.com/2015/04/04/peerj-peer-reviewed-research-asmr/" >2015, an analysis <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> indicated that 42 percent of individuals said ASMR helped them cope with chronic pain.</p><p>Scientists are still debating how ASMR can reduce chronic pain, although some relate it to the release of endorphins during an ASMR session. Endorphins are substances in the body that may make us happy and diminish our sense of pain. However, there is no authentication to support this idea.</p><p>Although they carried out a considerable study on ASMR and its impact on chronic pain, many individuals have found relief utilizing ASMR videos for their condition! If you suffer from chronic pain, try watching these ASMR videos for pleasure or to see if they help relieve your symptoms.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Is-ASMR-Good-For-You"><a href="#Part-3-Is-ASMR-Good-For-You" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Is ASMR Good For You?"></a>Part 3: Is ASMR Good For You?</h2><p>The study of ASMR is in its infancy at the moment. However, both anecdotal evidence and preliminary studies suggest that autonomic sensory meridian response, or ASMR, will have some positive effects, including the following:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/benefits-of-asmr-4.jpg"                      alt="is asmr good"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Immediate Relief:</strong> When someone experiences the chills and tingles associated with ASMR, we describe it as a delightful and calming sensation that occurs relatively quickly after exposure to the stimulus.</li><li><strong>The elevated state of mind</strong>: Early research found that after exposure to ASMR, eighty percent of Trusted Source participants experienced an improvement in their mood. People with greater levels of depression had a quicker drop in their benefits.</li><li><strong>Pain alleviation:</strong> The same research According to Reliable Source, some individuals who suffer from chronic pain had relief that lasted for up to three hours after being exposed to the substance.</li><li><strong>Greater intensity of focus</strong>: When you’re so engrossed in something that you lose track of time and concentrate so intently on it, you’re said to be in a “flow state.” Researchers have discovered that ASMR and the sort of focused attention you get when you’re in the zone, also known as flow, have been commonalities.</li><li><strong>Better sleep:</strong> ASMR has been found in preliminary studies to have the potential to assist in inducing a state of relaxation. Also, improve brainwave activity, which is necessary for a good night’s rest.</li><li><strong>Other advantages:</strong> People who participate in ASMR activities note improvements in areas such as decreased anxiety, fewer migraines, lower blood pressure, and other health benefits. Although they are consistent with what they tell us, these assertions still need to be supported by more studies.</li></ul><p>The best part is that almost anybody can use it. If you think these advantages may benefit you, you can try them. You can find out <strong>if ASMR is good for you</strong> without spending money or a doctor’s prescription online.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQ-People-Also-Ask"><a href="#Part-4-FAQ-People-Also-Ask" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQ: People Also Ask"></a>Part 4: FAQ: People Also Ask</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123512/26400" target="_top" id="2123512">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123512" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123512/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Does-ASMR-kill-brain-cells"><a href="#1-Does-ASMR-kill-brain-cells" class="headerlink" title="1.

Users with Facebook profiles use it as an identifier for other sites, seeing and sharing their videos and images, and much more. For some users, the video they post may not have the right video speed and want to change it. For example, if the length of the video is too long or the main person presenting the video is a slow speaker.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no preset setting on Facebook to increase the playback speed. So, <strong>can you speed up Facebook videos</strong> still?</p><p>The answer is yes, mainly with the help of other tools. In this article, let’s discuss the <strong>Facebook video speed controller</strong> options and how to carry out the process. Learn the step-by-step procedure and methods to carry it out on various device types here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/deep-dive-into-the-best-ways-to-speed-up-facebook-videos-1.jpg"                      alt="add an extension for increasing video speed"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="The-Best-Solutions-for-Changing-the-Speed-of-Videos-on-Facebook"><a href="#The-Best-Solutions-for-Changing-the-Speed-of-Videos-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook"></a>The Best Solutions for Changing the Speed of Videos on Facebook</h2><p>Multiple suitable solutions are available for users to try changing the Facebook videos they watch or play.

The software is accessible on desktop, in both Mac and Windows devices. Here, you will find many editing functions and features to optimize the quality and look of the videos.</p><p>But one of the best areas where Filmora excels is giving its users the ability to change speed easily through different methods. You can increase speed, reverse, or create slow-motion effect easily through the timeline icon for Speed or by double-clicking the video clip and choosing Speed Ramping. All the speed changing methods available here are simple to use and get used to on this software.</p><p>The three main speed adjustment methods of Filmora include:</p><p><strong>1. Uniform Speed</strong></p><p>The most usable method to change the speed of the video you add to Filmora is via Uniform Speed. After inserting the file, you can click on it and drag it to the editor timeline. There, right-click on it and choose Unform Speed. You can change the speed range and other options in the window for Uniform Speed.</p><p><strong>2. Speed Ramping</strong></p><p>For advanced speed adjustment on videos, you can try our Speed Ramping functionality on Filmora. To use it, you can choose the video in the timeline and choose Speed icon &gt; Speed Ramping. Or, right-click the video clip in the timeline and choose Speed Ramping.</p><p>There are 6 preset templates available for keyframe-based speed adjustment on this software. You can choose one of the pre-made speed ramp options or customize your personalized speed ramping effect, controlling the keyframes. Adjust the audio pitch as well.</p><p><strong>3. Change Speed via Timeline</strong></p><p>One of the easiest methods to <strong>speed up Facebook videos</strong> on Filmora is selecting and using the slider on the timeline to change speed. You can select the video clip and click on the icon for speed, shown as a tiny clock. Then, from the drop-down menu, click on Fast option and choose the speed between 2x to 100x.</p><p><strong>A Step-by-Step Guide to Speed Up a Video on Filmora</strong></p><p>While there are three different ways to change video speed, here are the steps for the most notable one- Unform Speed-based changes.</p><p>Step1 Launch the Filmora software and click on Create New Project.</p><p>Step2 Import the Facebook video you downloaded from your device. Drag it onto the editor timeline at the lower part of the screen.</p><p>Step3 You can right-click on the video clip in the timeline and choose Uniform from the drop-down menu. Or, choose the clip and click on the Speed icon above the timeline. Choose Uniform Speed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/deep-dive-into-the-best-ways-to-speed-up-facebook-videos-11.jpg"                      alt="click on the speed icon"                ></p><p>Step4 In the Uniform Speed panel, move the slider for speed to choose how much the video speed will increase. Click on Ripple Edit if there are two clips, and you automatically want the second one to start at the same speed as the former clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/deep-dive-into-the-best-ways-to-speed-up-facebook-videos-12.jpg"                      alt="move the slide for speed"                ></p><p>Step5 Press the OK button. If needed, continue editing the video clip or directly click the Export button. Choose the file format, make settings-based changes like frame rate, bitrate, etc., and then press Export.</p><p>Watch this <a class="link"   href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w6CEhFHnII" >video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to better understand how the speed adjustment and editing process work on Filmora.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Facebook does not give the ability to change video speed for users. In this case, it is best to use different external solutions that you can install to make speed changes to the video. Browser extensions are useful for desktop users, while iOS and Android users can try apps.</p><p>However, it would be best to use third-party software like Filmora after downloading the video separately for superior-quality video speed changes. There are multiple speed settings, and each one is easy to use.</p><p>Try all the methods mentioned in this post and watch the video on Facebook at your preferred speed choice.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unlocking-success-a-compre-pointed-guide-to-reddit-content-creation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unlocking Success A Compre Pointed Guide to Reddit Content Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-accelerate-your-adrenaline-the-ultimate-5-racing-game-list-for-2024/"><u>[New] Accelerate Your Adrenaline The Ultimate 5 Racing Game List for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-core-concepts-in-moving-graphic-artistry-for-2024/"><u>[New] Core Concepts in Moving Graphic Artistry for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-top-10-streamers-for-real-time-television-content/"><u>[New] Top 10 Streamers for Real-Time Television Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-maximizing-your-tech-efforts-a-detailed-look-at-showmores-features/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Maximizing Your Tech Efforts A Detailed Look at ShowMore’s Features</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-quick-shot-guide-for-chromebook-users/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Quick Shot Guide for Chromebook Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-creativity-exquisite-text-effects-for-adobes-affects/"><u>[Updated] Unleash Creativity Exquisite Text Effects For Adobe's Affects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://change-location.techidaily.com/detailed-guide-of-ispoofer-for-pogo-installation-on-samsung-galaxy-a05-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Detailed guide of ispoofer for pogo installation On Samsung Galaxy A05 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-effective-ways-to-fix-checkra1n-error-31-on-apple-iphone-xr-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Effective Ways To Fix Checkra1n Error 31 On Apple iPhone XR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-iphone-15-pro-without-passcode-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Unlock iPhone 15 Pro Without Passcode? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-rectifying-frequent-crashes-of-the-finals-application-on-pc-systems/"><u>Ultimate Guide: Rectifying Frequent Crashes of 'The Finals' Application on PC Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/vegas-pro-21-a-comprehenive-examination-for-gamblers-and-techies-alike-for-2024/"><u>Vegas Pro '21 A Comprehenive Examination for Gamblers and Techies Alike for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Both of these software offer unique media management services but when it comes to professional level real time applications then careful selection becomes essential. The article below can help you to make detailed comparison between VLC and MPC; probably you will soon be able to decide the right solution for your needs.</p><h2 id="Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC"><a href="#Comparison-of-VLC-and-MPC" class="headerlink" title="Comparison of VLC and MPC"></a>Comparison of VLC and MPC</h2><h3 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h3><p>There are very limited things to talk about user interfaces of both these software; they are quite simple. The design for MPC-HC is actually derived from its predecessor Media Player Classic and it originally follows the design track of Windows XP&#x2F;95 Media player. On the other side, VLC offers quite clunky icons with deep orange color that most of the time appear irritating to eyes.</p><p>The real difference lies between their features and menus where MPC-HC offers much organized service. It keeps all things at right place for both full screen and small screen modes whereas in case of VLC, users often need to organise a search for their desired content. MPC-HC retains its size even when video loops are formed but VLC immediately holds back the control to whole screen whenever playbacks start.</p><h3 id="Video-Support"><a href="#Video-Support" class="headerlink" title="Video Support"></a>Video Support</h3><p>When video files were tested on both these platforms, MPC-HC provides decent results. Even the 4K content was displayed well on MPC-HC but VLC caused little loss for frames while missing the smoothness in between.</p><p>MPC performed better for almost all media file tests but its performance decayed little bit with old MPEG-1 file format. However, both these players found difficulties for seeking track over WMV files but VLC somehow managed the longer jumps. When tests were performed for DVD and VCDs then both players performed better while handling all menus and elements with ease. Performance for non-protected type Blu-ray files was also significant in both cases.</p><p>The sad thing about VLC is that when it finds some problem for playing any media file then it often goes into infinite loops and they can be finally broken only with task manager. But in case of MPC-HC, when some files appear un supported to this platform it simply says no to it.</p><h3 id="Audio-Support"><a href="#Audio-Support" class="headerlink" title="Audio Support"></a>Audio Support</h3><p>MPC-HC as well as VLC, both these file formats supported WAV files perfectly up to 96KHz up to 32 bits. It also extends great support to standard compressed media file formats like APE&lt; FLAC, M4A, MP3 and Opus. You cannot play .VQF files on both these platforms.</p><p>VLC also finds trouble with Windows lossless files but MPC-HC can handle them well along with Apple Lossless content. In case of CD based playbacks, both these players worked well whereas performance of VLC was much smoother for track switching needs.</p><h3 id="Subtitles"><a href="#Subtitles" class="headerlink" title="Subtitles"></a>Subtitles</h3><p>For most of the subtitle tests, MPC-HC performed with acceptable quality but in case of VLC you have to drag subtitle file on top of the movie so that it can play it in synchronism.

Timing Is Everything"></a>1. Timing Is Everything</h3><p><em>“What is the best time to go live?”</em></p><p>There is no proper answer to this question. Several factors, like your target audience, your niche, and your geographic location, will play a part in the timing of going live. So here, we are going to give you some tips about time management.</p><p>Confirm a schedule with your guest (if you have one), ensuring you’re both on the same page about timing, even if you are not in the same time zone. For example, if you want a maximum live audience in the US, then the best time for you to live stream is when most US live stream viewers are active. You have to make sure your guest should make it to go live as well, irrespective of his time zone.</p><p>Secondly, it is also vital when to hold the live podcasting. It would help if you researched what time you will get the most audience. Consider what type of content you create and what lifestyle your audience leads, and decide accordingly.</p><p>Let’s get into this situation; a Sunday morning might be a good option if your podcast is about meditation and well-being, as it’s a classic time for taking things slow and resetting before the coming week.</p><p>Here is a summary of different social media platforms when you get the maximum audiences.</p><ul><li>YouTube - Weekends 12 PM to 2 PM</li><li>Facebook - Tuesdays and Thursdays 1 PM to 4 PM</li><li>Twitch - All days from 1 AM to 9 AM</li></ul><p>We now move on to take the most fundamental step of our work which is making a checklist of things to do.

Set Up Your Podcasting Gear Properly"></a>3. Set Up Your Podcasting Gear Properly</h3><p>Let’s run through various gadgets used to start live podcast streaming and how to make a live podcast. Let’s dive in!</p><p><strong>Camera</strong></p><p>Good display quality is the most integral part of live podcast streaming. Therefore, a reliable camera is essential for a live podcasting kit. The recommended tool for this purpose is a good-quality webcam. Unfortunately, many people use DSLR and mirrorless cameras, which aren’t suitable for shooting for a long time.</p><p>Here we have some fantastic products for you as an option. When it comes to visual fidelity, 4K resolution isn’t everything. Achieving superb quality is highly dependent on webcam light sensors and pixel size. Here are a few recommendations for you.</p><ol><li>Smartphones</li></ol><p>Everyone has a smartphone, and you don’t need to buy a new gadget, making it a cheaper and easier option. But there are difficulties connecting it to your PC or laptop.</p><ol start="2"><li>Webcams</li></ol><p>Many laptops and PC setups have internal webcams. However, the display gets grainy sometimes. You can also go for external webcams. The external webcams are tiny and portable. Maybe, you can try <a class="link"   href="https://www.razer.com/streaming-cameras/razer-kiyo-pro" >Razor Kiyo Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with more than two micrometers which is superior to other 4K webcams. If you are a beginner with a low budget, you can always go for alternatives.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-6.jpg"                      alt="razor kiyo pro"                ></p><ol start="3"><li>DSLR</li></ol><p>DSLR (digital single-lens reflex camera) is notable for allowing interchangeable lenses on the same camera body. However, it is just one type of digital camera. Investing in DSLR gives options for the future and provides crystal clear images, for example, <a href="https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/compact-digital-cameras/coolpix-b500.html"><strong>Nikon COOLPIX B500</strong></a>. It captures moments in full HD 1080p quality with stereo sound. It also counteracts shaky hands for tripod-steady videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-7.jpg"                      alt="nikon coolpix b500"                ></p><p><strong>XLR or USB Microphone</strong></p><p>You might have heard some things about XLR and USB microphones. For example, “XLR microphones sound more professional” or “USB microphones are less of a hassle.” Unfortunately, XLR can’t be connected directly to your computer. Instead, you’ll need an audio interface to enter the digital world and want to make recordings using your computer or smartphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/live-stream-podcast-8.jpg"                      alt="atr 2100x-usb"                ></p><ol><li>Condenser Podcasting Microphones</li></ol><p>Sensitive to high frequency and environmental noise.

How to Fade Audio with LumaFusion"></a>Part 1. How to Fade Audio with LumaFusion</h2><p>There are several capabilities in Luma Fusion that make precise editing possible, including ones that we haven’t seen in other mobile editing tools, such keyframing for all effects. Beginning filmmakers may use LumaFusion to discover their voice via editing. Their work may be moved to a desktop software after their abilities have grown on mobile. To start fading audio using Luma Fusion, follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 LumaFusion’s default structure is comparable to that of many desktops editing programs: a multitrack timeline along the bottom, a media browser in the upper left, and a preview monitor that, depending on what you last chose, either displays a source clip or your timeline edit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/lumafusion-timeline.jpg"                      alt="lumafusion timeline"                ></p><p>Step2 LumaFusion allows for the automated synchronization of up to 12 camera sources and several audio tracks. When a clip is loaded into LumaFusion, touch on it to open it in the viewer and then adjust the start and finish points.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/edit-sources-luma-fusion.jpg"                      alt="edit sources luma fusion"                ></p><p>Step3 From the choices, choose the Cross Dissolve (Fade) transition. The transition should be placed at the very end of your music channel timeline. Tap on the Help &amp; Settings menu to do this action. Look for Transition under the Settings menu and edit it to the appropriate duration. If you do this, your transition won’t take effect until you add it again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/fade-audio-in-luma-fusion.jpg"                      alt="fade audio in luma fusion"                ></p><p>Beyond simple editing, LumaFusion excels in enhancing projects with a wide variety of built-in effects, transitions, titles, and color correction.

The device costs around $6200, and it manages to bring in a weight of around 40 pounds. At a speed of 93km&#x2F;h, it’s very fast and it can bring you a 5.2k camera. It’s definitely one of the best drones that can bring you complete aerial photography and a set of resounding features for your money. The manufacturer added multi-rotor features here and the fact that you can easily capture anything with great detail works to your advantage.</p><p> Aside from that, here you have a dual battery design which is rather distinct and you also acquire a very fast acceleration. This means you get to capture the videos you want on the spot and that on its own is rather wonderful to say the least. It’s one of the better professional drones as well, and at this price you can’t really ask for more. Is it worth it? Yes, you do get plenty of value for your money and if you are a professional film maker or photographer, you can make quite a lot of money from it.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> very easy to use and maneuver, fast, 27 minutes of flight time and 5.2k camera</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> expensive and pretty heavy</p><h4 id="2-Best-drone-for-real-estate-use-DJI-Phantom-4"><a href="#2-Best-drone-for-real-estate-use-DJI-Phantom-4" class="headerlink" title="2.

You can easily save time when you use it, because you can capture the interior footage you want with little to no effort. They did a very good job at bringing a 120 FPS mode. The 12 MP still photos also have a very good quality, which is really what you want to have with this model. The combination of great photos and videos made with this drone show the unique value you can receive from it, so you may want to check it out for that reason alone. Is this a resounding investment? Yes, if you do want a nice quality and great features, you will find that this model does deliver on all of that.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> 4k camera, 28 minutes of flight time, 120 FPS mode</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> It can be too noisy at times</p><h4 id="3-Best-professional-drones-for-agriculture-DJI-Agras-MG-1"><a href="#3-Best-professional-drones-for-agriculture-DJI-Agras-MG-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

You need to make sure that you study the soil and field quality, not to mention you need to assess the health and irrigation of your crops. The DJI Agras MG-1 does a very good job here because its battery lasts for around 24 minutes. It’s a heavy drone at around 8.8 kg, but then again you do have a good and reliable drone that can be monitored and used in any way you want. The liquid tank capacity has around 10 liters and you can use it for spraying as well. They added a smart mode too and the motor is very good at managing battery power. It’s one of the best and most efficient drones out there for agricultural use and the experience you get from using it is very good.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> great features for agricultural use, suitable for spraying crops, great flight time duration</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive (Almost $15000), maneuverability can be better.</p><h4 id="4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan"><a href="#4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan" class="headerlink" title="4.

The price of around $12000 seems rather prohibitive, but the drone is particularly used for taking pictures and it does a very good job at that. It’s very stable and the camera comes with a stabilizer, so each one of the pictures works great and it manages to deliver an incredible value for your money because of that reason alone. You can use the captured images and footage to convert it into 3D models and contour maps if you want.</p><p> It works great for both enterprise and startup use, not to mention that its mapping features are great and to the point. You can charge it for around 1.5 hours, which is a pretty good time for a regular drone.</p><p> Also, you can outline the area that you want to survey on the map and the drone will fly itself. This is a nifty feature and one that many professional drones should start using sooner rather than later.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> You can outline the desired region and make it fly automatically, great image quality, stable and with a great performance.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>  the price of around $12000 is rather high</p><h4 id="5-Best-drones-for-surveillance-Yuneec-Q500-Typhoon"><a href="#5-Best-drones-for-surveillance-Yuneec-Q500-Typhoon" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s light at around 1.1kg, not to mention that it costs solely $800, so it’s not an expensive purchase either. Thanks to the 4K video and the 25 minutes of usage, you can easily capture great footage and use it without any problem in a wide variety of situations. The quality you receive is very good and the experience as a whole is a very distinct one. You should consider giving it a try because it does have all the best video capture features out there and it works really well.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> amazing video capture capabilities, great price, lightweight, durable battery</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> controls are a bit iffy at times</p><p> All these professional drones are great for a particular industry.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Elite-6-Online-Spaces-Fueling-Business-Success"><a href="#Elite-6-Online-Spaces-Fueling-Business-Success" class="headerlink" title="Elite 6 Online Spaces Fueling Business Success"></a>Elite 6 Online Spaces Fueling Business Success</h2><p>Social media is a great way of promoting your business. With so many platforms, it can be hard to know which ones to use, so here’s a guide to some of the best social media platforms for business.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/business-social-media-platforms.jpg"                      alt="business social media platforms"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h2><p>TikTok is a video-sharing platform. It’s the most popular video-sharing platform in the world and has 30.8 Million daily active users. TikTok was founded by Zhang Yiming, who also founded Byte Dance, which owns TikTok. TikTok is based in Beijing, China, and was launched in September 2016.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/tiktok-app.jpg"                      alt="tiktok app"                ></p><p>It’s great for promoting your business with short, engaging videos. You can use TikTok to show off your products, give behind-the-scenes looks at your business, or even just tell your brand story. You can also use TikTok to run ads.</p><h2 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2><p>Facebook currently has 1.908 billion daily active users, giving it a huge audience to reach customers. Facebook also has a lot of information about its users, which means they can target their ads more effectively than other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/facebook-app.jpg"                      alt="facebook app"                ></p><p>Facebook’s advertising options are extensive and include Pros and Cons:</p><p>Advantages include being able to show your product at different stages in its lifecycle (e.g., pre-order vs. purchase); being able to target what kind of consumer you want; and having access to analytics that allow you to see how well your ads are performing (i.e., number of clicks&#x2F;impression).</p><p>Disadvantages include not knowing if people are going directly from clicking on an ad and buying something else online instead; not being able to tell if someone who saw an ad might have come back later to buy something from you instead, or spending too much money on ads without seeing results immediately (the latter is one reason why some businesses don’t like using Facebook as much).</p><h2 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2><p>Twitter, the platform that started off as a way for people to share their thoughts up to 280 characters or less, has become much more than that. It is a great way to communicate with your customers and it can also help make your brand stand out. Twitter allows you to engage with potential customers and get feedback from them about what they think of your product or service.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/twitter-app.jpg"                      alt="twitter app"                ></p><p>If you want customer service feedback in real-time then Twitter is probably one of the best ways to do it because users are always on their phones looking at social media throughout the day. Also, Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use so if someone needs help they can easily get it by tweeting someone who works there directly.</p><h2 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why YouTube is a great platform for business. Here are some of them:</p><p>You can create and share content. If you want to start sharing your knowledge with the world, then this is a good place to start. The only thing you need is a camera and an internet connection!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/youtube-app.jpg"                      alt="youtube app"                ></p><p>It’s a great place to connect with people who have similar interests as you do, or even just connect with people in general (if what they’re interested in has something to do with your field).</p><p>You can learn things too! There are tons of tutorials available on YouTube that will teach any skill imaginable - everything from learning how to play guitar or speak Spanish, all the way up through creating entire websites from scratch (which may be more than some people want). If there’s something specific that interests me personally then I know I’ll probably find it there somewhere because there are millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day by millions upon millions of different people worldwide.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h2><p>Instagram is a visual platform, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the best social media platforms for business.

It can be used to find customers, connect with industry thought leaders, and build relationships with other businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/linkedin-app.jpg"                      alt="linkedin app"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098701/14409" target="_top" id="2098701">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098701" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098701/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>LinkedIn is also a great place to post content, whether it’s articles, videos, or infographics. This is because LinkedIn users are generally more engaged than users of other social media platforms, and they’re more likely to read and share content that is interesting and relevant to their industry.</p><p>One disadvantage of LinkedIn is that it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd if you’re not a large or well-known company. This is because there are already so many businesses on LinkedIn, and many of them are already well-established.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, what’s the best social media platform for your business? I think the answer is different for everyone. The important thing is that you find out where your customers are and how they use social media. Then, you can join them on their favorite platforms and connect with them there.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-crafting-subc-from-srt-efficient-actionable-paths/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Crafting SUBC From SRT Efficient, Actionable Paths</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-redesigning-the-perception-of-sony-s3700-review/"><u>[New] In 2024, Redesigning the Perception of Sony S3700 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-snap-into-the-loop-mastering-boomerangs-for-max-impact/"><u>[Updated] Snap Into the Loop Mastering Boomerangs for Max Impact</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-guide-to-integrating-music-and-editing-in-canva-vids/"><u>2024 Approved The Guide to Integrating Music & Editing in Canva Vids</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/easy-steps-on-how-to-create-a-new-apple-id-account-on-apple-iphone-6-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Easy Steps on How To Create a New Apple ID Account On Apple iPhone 6</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-editing.techidaily.com/in-2024-mirror-your-media-how-to-flip-a-clip-in-final-cut-pro-quickly/"><u>In 2024, Mirror Your Media How to Flip a Clip in Final Cut Pro Quickly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/in-2024-start-promoting-smart-a-beginners-guide-to-using-telegram/"><u>In 2024, Start Promoting Smart A Beginner's Guide to Using Telegram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-macs-premier-screen-capture-tools/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Mac's Premier Screen Capture Tools</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Most companies and content creators today use them in their videos to facilitate easy understanding of their videos. Thus, allowing their videos to get higher engagement and views.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-create-a-srt-file-for-video-on-Windows"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-create-a-srt-file-for-video-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to create a .srt file for video on Windows?"></a>Part 2: How to create a .srt file for video on Windows?</h2><p>To create a .srt file for your video on a Windows computer is pretty simple. Yes, you don’t require technical knowledge or any third-party software for such an operation. All it takes is just a few clicks.</p><p>That being said, keep in mind that before you start creating SRT subtitles for your video, you must have reviewed your video and have a copy of the audio&#x2F;dialogue that you want to use as a caption in the SRT file. This will prevent you from making errors during the SRT creation process.</p><p>The stepwise guide illustrated below will walk you through how to create an SRT file for video in Windows;</p><p>Step1 Start your Windows computer and open the Notepad program. Then create a new file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-1.jpg"                      alt="create a new file"                ></p><p>Step2 Up next, play your video and listen to the first line of the dialogue. Then pause it and write your first subtitle in the note by doing the following;</p><ul><li>Type 1 &gt; under it, write the first Timestamp. The timestamp should be written in hours:minutes: seconds, milliseconds format as shown below;</li></ul><p><em>1</em></p><ul><li><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></li></ul><p>The times displayed indicate the beginning and end of when the subtitle appears on the viewer’s screen. Ensure to make this time as accurate as possible.</p><p>Step3 Move to the next line and type your subtitle content - the text that will show on the screen. This should be one or two sentences. Long texts should be broken into multiple subtitles to make them easy for viewers to understand.</p><p>Step4 Repeat steps 2&amp;3 for the remaining subtitle contents.</p><p>Below is an example of what an SRT subtitle should look like;</p><p><em>1</em></p><p><em>00:00:07,114 –&gt; 00:00:11,834</em></p><p><em>Hello, and welcome to our presentation.</em></p><p><em>2</em></p><p><em>00:00:012,108 –&gt; 00:00:16,357</em></p><p><em>In this video, we’ll be showing</em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="an example of an srt subtitle"                ></p><p>Step5 Review the subtitle and edit every error after you’ve completed it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="review subtitle"                ></p><p>Step6 Finally, save the file in .srt format by clicking <strong>‘File’ &gt; Save.</strong> Then under <strong>‘Save As’</strong> enter the file name and add .srt as the preferred extension for your file.

If it’s a long text, you need to break it down into multiple subtitles.</p><p>Step4 Repeat step 2&amp;3 for the remaining subtitle contents.</p><p>See what an SRT subtitle looks like below;</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-to-create-srt-file-for-video-on-mac-1.jpg"                      alt="an example of an srt subtitle on mac"                ></p><p>Step5 Review and edit the subtitle.</p><p>Step6 To complete the operation, click <strong>‘File’</strong> at the top bar and select <strong>Save</strong> from the drop-down.

Pros and Cons of Telegram Marketing"></a>Part 1. Pros and Cons of Telegram Marketing</h2><p>Firstly, let’s look into why we should seize the opportunities to develop marketing on Telegram. Following are the pros of Telegram marketing:</p><ul><li>Cost-effective way to reach a wide audience. This will be presented in the Part 2 and Part 3 of this article.</li><li>Increased user engagement as the there are more and more active users on T</li><li>Improved traffic on the website resulting in increased conversions.</li><li>More brand exposure due to highly active Telegram groups.</li></ul><p>Besides, apart from the benefits Telegram Marketing can bring to you, we also list a few cons of it as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Telegram Is Not a Public Platform</strong>: This means your messages will be private as intended. However, it also means that you will have to build your network of followers interested in what you have to say before reaching out to them with marketing messages.</li><li><strong>Difficult Access to a Wider Audience:</strong> Telegram is mainly used by cryptocurrency enthusiasts and those already familiar with blockchain technology. As such, it will be difficult for you to reach out to those people who have not heard about blockchain or crypts yet.</li><li><strong>Less Engagement</strong>: Another disadvantage of Telegram marketing is less engagement compared to other social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. It can be challenging to hunt for people who want to follow your brand on Telegram. Also, it won’t be easy to keep them engaged in your community after finding them.</li><li><strong>The Inability to Track User Activity:</strong> There are no analytics tools available on Telegram. For example, you can’t use Google Analytics or other similar tools to track engagement and conversions to understand your target audience and establish what works for them.</li><li><strong>No Public Visibility for Your Brand:</strong> No public platform means no public visibility for your brand or product. You can expect only those people to see your marketing content already using the Telegram platform and have added you as a friend.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Marketing-Opportunities-on-Telegram"><a href="#Part-2-Marketing-Opportunities-on-Telegram" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.
