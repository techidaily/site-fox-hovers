It was very clear from the developers that they are still launching games keeping the PC and Smart Phones in mind. These are still the most popular platforms where 49 percent of the developers made their latest release on PC&#x2F;Mac, around 41 percent chose smart phones and tablets to be the best medium.</p><p> It is quite clear from the discussion that the game developers prefer PC&#x2F;Laptops&#x2F;Mac over any other devices to release their games. But, this year’s survey came up with a different result where 59.7 percent developers preferably chose PC&#x2F;Mac followed by 48.3 percent developers who chose virtual reality headsets for their upcoming games. So, we can say that despite the indomitable popularity of the PC and Mac, virtual reality is also gaining a strong ground.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/google-cardbaorad-1.jpg"                      alt="google-cardbaorad-1"                ></p><h2 id="The-VR-gaming-development-is-truly-rising-then"><a href="#The-VR-gaming-development-is-truly-rising-then" class="headerlink" title="The VR gaming development is truly rising then"></a>The VR gaming development is truly rising then</h2><p> Is it really the right time to make comment like virtual reality is really uprising as a gaming platform? If you take the year of year survey report, yes the result shows a significant uptick for the interest of this platform. If we look back at the last year’s survey, it revealed that only 33.4 percent of the developers were interested to develop games for VR platforms. If you consider in terms of interest, VR was placed behind the PC&#x2F;Mac, PlayStation 4, smartphones or tablets. But, considering this year’s data, we can see more advancement in the interest for the VR platform! More and more European developers are now getting interested to develop games for VR platforms that the smartphones or tablets.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-gaming1.jpg"                      alt="vr-gaming"                ></p><p> This clears the air that VR is turning to be an emerging platform for the European game developers but, which one is preferred more by the professional game developers – is it the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive or something else for that matter? The survey also includes a detailed report on that as well. Asking about which VR platform they are using – 23.1 percent developers said they are using Rift, Vive is slightly behind with 22 percent developers’ preferences. There is PlayStation VR headset as well with 11.8 percent preferences.</p><p> However, despite having such acceptance by the professional game developers, the confidence for the VR games market seems to have dropped a bit – at least the recent survey is showing something like that. Last year, 71.7 percent of the game developers considered VR to be a sustainable long-term market while in this year, it slipped a little with 68.8 percent developers are thinking VR could be a long sustaining gaming market.</p><h2 id="About-the-European-VR-game-makers-and-their-funding"><a href="#About-the-European-VR-game-makers-and-their-funding" class="headerlink" title="About the European VR game makers and their funding"></a>About the European VR game makers and their funding</h2><p> Funding for the games has always remained one of the prime concerns for the game developers and publishers. You know that it takes large amounts to be invested for the games. When it comes to the funding policies for the European game developers, most of them are covering the entire expenses using their own funds. Take a look at what the survey report has to say about that. Asking about the sources of the fund for the games 57.8 percent said that their funds come from the company’s existing fund while contrary to this, 32.9 percent game developers said that they manage their own fund from their personal accounts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/resource/vr-developer.jpg"                      alt="vr-developer"                ></p><p> We know that crowdsourced funding is also a preferable way to manage funds but, this seems not very convenient for the VR game developers since a very poor percentage (5.2) of the developers replied that they are working on games the fund of which is crowdsourced. While some developers consider this as an awful idea, some mentioned this to be a tricky process.</p><p> Overall, this is what cooking inside the VR gaming world and this survey report explains the different aspects of virtual reality that clearly presents the state of the VR industry on this year – 2016. Hopefully, we will come across much more advancement to this process in the coming years since gaming on VR headsets is massively exciting and fun.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-journey-through-filmora-editing-10-standout-functions/"><u>2024 Approved  Journey Through Filmora Editing  10 Standout Functions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-meme-magic-unleashed-top-humorous-creations-for-the-metaverse-world/"><u>2024 Approved  Meme Magic Unleashed  Top Humorous Creations for the Metaverse World</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-harmonizing-visuals-and-soundtracks-with-youtubes-video-editor/"><u>In 2024, Harmonizing Visuals & Soundtracks with YouTube's Video Editor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-integrating-obs-streams-with-the-worlds-largest-social-network-fb-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Integrating OBS Streams with the World's Largest Social Network, FB for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimal-video-player-windows-ios-android/"><u>In 2024, Optimal Video Player  Windows, iOS, Android</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-bypass-icloud-activation-lock-with-imei-code-from-your-iphone-6s-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code From your iPhone 6s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-engage-grow-and-rise-triple-threat-tactics-for-facebook-pages-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Engage, Grow, and Rise  Triple Threat Tactics for Facebook Pages for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-the-top-gaming-intro-creation-services-ranked-and-reviewed/"><u>New The Top Gaming Intro Creation Services Ranked and Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-strategies-to-prevent-account-suspension-on-youtube/"><u>[Updated] Strategies to Prevent Account Suspension on YouTube</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-guide-to-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-frp-bypass-with-best-methods-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Easy Guide to Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 FRP Bypass With Best Methods</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-seamless-facebook-live-experience-combat-interruptions/"><u>[New] In 2024, Seamless Facebook Live Experience  Combat Interruptions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-no-fuss-streaming-technique-for-podcasts/"><u>[New] No-Fuss Streaming Technique for Podcasts</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

They prefer to watch videos as opposed to reading text-based review. The demand for good review is high with companies and business looking to get reviews of their product on YouTube through popular reviewer.</p><p>YouTube is the second largest search engine after Google and has a billion users a month. This makes YouTube an attractive platform to post product reviews and build trust with consumers.</p><p>Good product review videos give that last push to your potential customers to buy the product you are endorsing. Lastly feedback from these reviews will help your viewers to either purchase or not.</p><p>Product review video creation thus became profitable career for many, so in this article will guide you to create excellent products review channel.</p><p>When creating a YouTube channel, you need to make sure that you have all the equipment needed to start making the content you have chosen which is the product review video. If you are really determined to create one, you don’t need to buy expensive vlogging equipment right away, you can use what you have now if the video is clear and the audio is good.</p><h2 id="What-are-the-things-needed-to-make-a-quality-video"><a href="#What-are-the-things-needed-to-make-a-quality-video" class="headerlink" title="What are the things needed to make a quality video?"></a>What are the things needed to make a quality video?</h2><p><strong>Camera for video:</strong> If you only have your smart phone, that’s good to go if the video is working</p><p><strong>Good Lighting:</strong> Open window for the natural sunlight to come in, better to make video around 8am to 10am you will get the good sunlight that time. But there is affordable ring light in the online shop that you can purchased. Most content creator use right light for steady light and proper video lighting</p><p><strong>Stand&#x2F;Tripod:</strong> Tripod used if you have digital camera and you can use phone stand for your mobile phone for steady video. There is also affordable stand that you can buy online</p><p><strong>Lapel Microphone:</strong> Use lapel microphone that can be connected even if you are using mobile phone for vlogging. This can make your audio quality good and clear.</p><p><strong>Place&#x2F;Studio:</strong> Find extra space in your room where you can sit to vlog properly. Also look for a good background, one that doesn’t grab the viewers’ attention much better to use plain background.</p><p><strong>Products:</strong> Products that you will make a review, the one that you think you can stand until the end. Like for example you can change the brand of the products but you should stick to that type of product, like if you want to talk about Tech then you will do all reviews about Tech, if it’s about skin care product then all the reviews should also be done about skin care.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/things-to-prepare-product-review-video.jpg"                      alt="things to prepare product review video"                ></p><h2 id="Things-to-consider-to-start-Product-Review-Channel"><a href="#Things-to-consider-to-start-Product-Review-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Things to consider to start Product Review Channel"></a>Things to consider to start Product Review Channel</h2><h3 id="Create-a-YouTube-Channel"><a href="#Create-a-YouTube-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Create a YouTube Channel"></a><strong>Create a YouTube Channel</strong></h3><p>Before you do a product review, you need to create a YouTube channel where you can post the product review videos you made. There you can get paid for the videos you made thru Google Adsense when your channel is Monetized. But if you’re just starting out, don’t think that you’ll make money right away, because it’s not that easy. Before you can earn on YouTube you must first pass the requirements that YouTube asks for you to become a partner, it is to have 1,000 Subscriber and 4,000 watch hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/select-right-product-to-review.jpg"                      alt="select right product to review"                ></p><p>However, it’s important to note that even from there, YouTube will still evaluate your channel for other strict criteria to make sure it is complying with all their policies and best practices outside of watch time and watch hours minimums.</p><p>For now, just do you job and create a quality video to soon be monetized.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/results-of-qulaity-product-video.jpg"                      alt="results of qulaity product video"                ></p><h3 id="Kind-of-Products-to-Review"><a href="#Kind-of-Products-to-Review" class="headerlink" title="Kind of Products to Review"></a><strong>Kind of Products to Review</strong></h3><p>Start by reviewing products you have, because nobody is going to give out a free product to someone who’s never uploaded a review. Of course, it’s important from the starts you really need to invest in the product you want to review, so you can start a video reviewing product on your channel if that’s the content you’ve chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/decide-product-review-type.jpg"                      alt="decide product review type"                ></p><p>For the Brand to notice your video, buy some of their products that you think useful to you and make a review about it, make sure to make a video review creative to stands out to another reviewer. So that when the Brands see your video they will be amazed by at your work. But just make sure that the product your reviewing is approved to or you don’t have any issue with the products, because remember it’s not just the Brand eyeing to your work but the viewers are also looking for such a review.</p><p>When you have a lot of product review video on you channel, other Brands will approach you to offer you to do a review on their product and sometime they also offer payment. But they only offer the payment when they think it’s worth it or they get some sales. In regard with this I’m talking about your community or Subscribers count, because Brands only offer payment for your video if you have stable or more subscribers’ count. So, if you don’t have many subscribers yet, you need to work hard to increase your viewers and patient is more important in this kind of field.</p><p>I recommend sticking with the same kind of products and specialize so that the viewers will familiar that you are the one doing that kind of review. They know immediately whose channel they should search of they ever need your review.</p><h3 id="Script-about-the-Products"><a href="#Script-about-the-Products" class="headerlink" title="Script about the Products"></a><strong>Script about the Products</strong></h3><p>Here is some basic information on how you make a quality script</p><ol><li>The basic information about the products example the price, size, ingredients and or materials</li><li>Where you got</li><li>What you liked about the products</li><li>What you didn’t like</li><li>Worth to buy or not</li><li>Recommendation or your personal thoughts about the product</li></ol><p>Just like product demo videos, product review videos also need a proper script before recording so that you cover everything that you want to without missing any key aspects of the product that you’re reviewing. Keep the review short and to the point because potential customers have come to your channel to watch the review of the product in the market. Concentrate on the products and explain the features in detail to help users determine if the products suit them. You can add your opinion to humanize the product features. As an Influencer, the main purpose of doing product review is to get people to buy the products you feature. You need to build credibly with customers for them to buy what you recommend. To achieve this, you need to give your genuine review by highlight the pros and cons of the product. This will get you the potential customer or subscriber who will happy to buy the products you are endorsing.</p><h3 id="Good-Editing"><a href="#Good-Editing" class="headerlink" title="Good Editing"></a><strong>Good Editing</strong></h3><p>Editing is important if you want to look good. People don’t like to watch long boring video so try making video short crisp and try a good reliable video editing software.

Many viewers on necessarily don’t care if a video is sponsored or not, they mainly want creator to give a useful opinion. The most important part of those process is to be patient. Expect it to take a months before get notice of people, getting subscriber is complicated and you feel like giving up, but the more reviews you have, the better. Thus, in the beginning you won’t make anything until you put in the work, but you can see how you can go from 0 subscribers or views to 1000 once you build up a nice content, all from your single YouTube channel.

For example, the main difference between cloth vendors&#x2F;manufacturers is brand identity. In a simple term, “what makes your brand different from the competitors?” – your logo is one of the answers. <strong>Free logo templates</strong> are easy to use, customizable, and applicable for brand promotion and recognition. Although most <strong>logo templates</strong> are customizable, some are not editable. This article talks about editable and not editable free logo templates. Learn more below.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Free-logo-templates-Editable"><a href="#Part-1-Free-logo-templates-Editable" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Free logo templates (Editable)"></a>Part 1: Free logo templates (Editable)</h2><p>Editable logo templates differ from other templates because they support modification and diversification. Customizing a template gives total access and quality creation in your care. In short, if it is editable, you remove, add, and save a modified version of a logo template. All logo makers are not free or easy to edit; however, some editable free logo templates include:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.canva.com/create/logos/"><strong>Canva</strong></a></li></ol><p>Canva is an essential logo template maker.

Canva AI algorithm suggests designs based on your history. For example, you locate resourceful raw collections for projects without much stress. The beautiful algorithm feature is important if you create more than one logo.</p><p>The Canva (free) feature includes free download (limited resolution), limited editing tools, and unlimited space work.

The vector graphics put you at a high resolution to size ratio: maintaining a quality resolution irrespective of the log size.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adobe-express.jpg"                      alt="adobe logo maker"                ></p><p>Tips: Adobe also provides a lot of well-customized templates involving various styles and types.

GIFs offer an endless source of fun, and it is only reasonable that some iPhone owners want to create GIF collections on their phones.</p><p><strong>You May Also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best 10 GIF Apps for iPhone &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong></p><p> In this tutorial, we will show you how you can save GIFs from any other social media platform like Tumblr, Twitter, and share them with your friends via messages or emails directly from your iPhone.</p><h2 id="How-to-Download-and-Save-GIFs-on-an-iPhone"><a href="#How-to-Download-and-Save-GIFs-on-an-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="How to Download and Save GIFs on an iPhone"></a>How to Download and Save GIFs on an iPhone</h2><p> Regardless of which version iOS you have on your iPhone, saving GIFs on your device isn’t complicated at all, but some older versions of iOS require third-party apps in order to be able to play GIFs.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Section 1: iOS 11 Users:</a></li><li><a href="#part1">Section 2: iOS 10 or Earlier:</a></li></ul><h3 id="Section-1-iOS-11-Users"><a href="#Section-1-iOS-11-Users" class="headerlink" title="Section 1: iOS 11 Users"></a>Section 1: iOS 11 Users</h3><p> After waiting for so long iPhone owners can finally enjoy the benefits of the GIFs feature in the Photos app. These simple steps will show you how to save any GIF you like in just a few taps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Once you’ve found a GIF you’d like to store on your phone, tap on the image and hold until the menu appears on the screen, and then pick the Save GIF option, to save it on your Camera Roll.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-album.PNG"                                     ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now that the GIF is saved on your iPhone, you can always access it from the Photos app. Your GIF collection is located in the Animated folder, and if at any point you would like to take a look at a GIF you saved, you can just open the Animated folder. Simply tap on any GIF to display it in full-screen mode, but if the GIF isn’t stored locally on your iPhone you’ll need to wait for a few seconds until it’s downloaded from the iCloud Photo Library.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-gif.PNG"                                     ></p><h3 id="Section-2-iOS-10-or-Earlier"><a href="#Section-2-iOS-10-or-Earlier" class="headerlink" title="Section 2: iOS 10 or Earlier"></a>Section 2: iOS 10 or Earlier</h3><p> The process of saving a GIF on iOS 10 or earlier versions of iOS is virtually the same as the one on iOS 11. So, after you’ve discovered a GIF you’d like to save, tap on it to activate the 3D touch, or just tap and hold the image if your iPhone doesn’t have this feature. In either case, simply choose the Save option once the new window appears on your screen.</p><p> Go to the Photos app, where the GIF you saved is located, and you’ll see that the GIF is motionless, and it will be displayed as a photo until you send it to someone via Messages or Email.</p><p> Installing a third party app on your iPhone will enable you to save and look at GIFs from your iPhone. An app like GifWrapped or GifPlayerFree will allow you to view GIFs or create an entire collection of GIFs on your iPhone even if you have iOS 10 or some earlier version of the operating system installed on your device.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best GIF Text Makers to Generate Your Text Simple &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="GIF-tool-That-Offers-You-More-Editing-Features"><a href="#GIF-tool-That-Offers-You-More-Editing-Features" class="headerlink" title="GIF tool That Offers You More Editing Features"></a>GIF tool That Offers You More Editing Features</h2><p> Despite the fact that viewing GIFs on iOS 11 is now possible, GIF enthusiasts still can’t edit GIFs on their iPhones.

This is especially true; an unsteady hand, poor lighting, or low-quality technology can prevent all damage to a video.</p><p>You’re in luck if you’ve ever wondered how to improve video quality. We’re going to look over the finest video quality enhancers today. Many video enhancers have been launched so far, and you might find it difficult to choose one for you. Let’s begin:</p><h2 id="Video-enhancer-2-2"><a href="#Video-enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Video enhancer 2.2"></a>Video enhancer 2.2</h2><p>Video Enhancer is an application that uses the Super Resolution approach to boost video resolution. Super Resolution is a clever video upsizing method that uses information from neighboring frames to upsize the current frame. It gathers data. Therefore the more sequential frames processed, the greater the quality.</p><p>If the image in your video doesn’t change too quickly, information from multiple frames can be combined to create a larger image, showing details that would otherwise be concealed. However, no regular image resize&#x2F;resample techniques can achieve this quality because there isn’t enough information in one frame.</p><h3 id="How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2"><a href="#How-to-use-Video-Enhancer-2-2" class="headerlink" title="How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?"></a>How to use Video Enhancer 2.2?</h3><p>Video Enhancers allow you to:</p><ul><li>Increase the resolution of your video with the Video Super-Resolution approach, which gives incredible quality by leveraging information from prior frames.
