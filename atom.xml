Thankfully there are certain GoPro settings which can be tweaked to maximize the GoPro battery life and in this article we are going to discuss a few easy ways of improving your GoPro battery life.

There is always a possibility that your GoPro firmware isn’t actually updated. Doing this would not just fix any recurrent problems which you might be having with your camera but it would also improve the battery life immensely because of any fixes implemented by the company. The GoPro firmware can be updated by connecting the cam to a smartphone over Wi-Fi and then by updating it with the help of the GoPro app. In case you are using an older model you have to download the firmware which is available on the GoPro website and then transfer it to your GoPro SD card and run the update from your cam.</p><h4 id=""><a href="#" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h4><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01M14ATO0/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01M14ATO0&linkId=5ce54ea937ecffa6b1b8056b6922abaa" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>2. Keep the cam turned off when not in use</p><p> This sounds pretty obvious doesn’t it? When you turn on your camera but not recording anything then the battery gets drains slowly. So make sure to keep your GoPro switched off whenever you are not shooting so as to save the battery. The Quick Capture is an useful feature which allows the cam to start recording instantly whenever it is powered on.</p><h4 id="3-Use-the-“Auto-Power-Off-Setting”"><a href="#3-Use-the-“Auto-Power-Off-Setting”" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the “Auto Power Off Setting”"></a>3. Use the “Auto Power Off Setting”</h4><p> Many of us forget to switch on our cameras after shooting and this slowly depletes the camera’s battery. If you are one of those people who always forget to turn off the camera only to find a low battery indication after some time then what you need to do is turn on the ‘Auto Power Off Setting’. All you have to do is go to the settings menu and then click on the button 13 times till you have the option to select the number of seconds you would like to give your cam till it shuts down automatically. You can choose from 60, 120, and 300 seconds.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-auto-power-off-setting.jpg"                      alt="Save GoPro battery life"                ></p><h4 id="4-Turn-off-the-red-indicator-and-beeping-lights"><a href="#4-Turn-off-the-red-indicator-and-beeping-lights" class="headerlink" title="4. Turn off the red indicator and beeping lights"></a>4. Turn off the red indicator and beeping lights</h4><p> The red light which constantly blinks while shooting a footage is not just a major distraction to the viewer but also a cause of battery drainage. This red indicator light is meant for letting the user know when the cam is recording. However professional cinematographers will easily learn that as long as the record button is pressed properly the GoPro is going to start shooting no matter if the red light is blinking or not. Though the light indicator doesn’t have that much of an impact on the overall battery life but when it comes to battery life improvement every little thing helps.</p><h4 id="5-Turn-off-the-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth"><a href="#5-Turn-off-the-Wi-Fi-and-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="5. Turn off the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth"></a>5. Turn off the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</h4><p> Just like any other devices, turning off the WIFI and Bluetooth in your GoPro cam can greatly help to enhance the battery life. Turning of these 2 could extend your battery life by about 10-15 minutes. Make sure not to accidentally press the WIFI button at the side of your camera while shooting.</p><h4 id="6-Give-up-the-Remote-and-the-smartphone-app"><a href="#6-Give-up-the-Remote-and-the-smartphone-app" class="headerlink" title="6. Give up the Remote and the smartphone app"></a>6. Give up the Remote and the smartphone app</h4><p> The remote control of your GoPro is not just difficult to use but also takes a toll on the battery life of the camera. It could lower the overall battery life of your cam by about 15%-20% depending on the usage. Try using a selfie stick instead of the remote. Avoid pairing your cam with your phone since it’s more of a wastage of your time and the camera battery. So leave the remote behind and stop playing with your smartphone so as to shoot a lot more footage with your GoPro.</p><h4 id="7-Reduce-the-frame-rate-or-the-recording-resolution"><a href="#7-Reduce-the-frame-rate-or-the-recording-resolution" class="headerlink" title="7. Reduce the frame rate or the recording resolution"></a>7. Reduce the frame rate or the recording resolution</h4><p> Always keep in mind that the less the number of pixels and frames your camera is recording the less battery it uses. Try to have the video setting of your GoPro set to 1080p but for a special reason to shoot in ultra HD. Also make sure to turn off the Protune feature in your camera. The 1080p at 60 fps is the norm for shooting any GoPro footage. However you can always reduce it to 720p or leave it at 1080p only with 30 frames per sec instead of 60 unless you are shooting a professional video with the best possible res. If you are just shooting for fun then 720p is surely going to work great and more importantly it would give you more footage in the end.</p><h4 id="8-Keep-the-LCD-screen-turned-off"><a href="#8-Keep-the-LCD-screen-turned-off" class="headerlink" title="8. Keep the LCD screen turned off"></a>8. Keep the LCD screen turned off</h4><p> The LCD screens in the new GroPro are a superb feature which not only allows you to see whatever you are recording but also change the setting more conveniently. However the LCD screen can substantially drain the battery so when you want to capture more footage its best for you to turn off the LCD and shoot in the old school way.</p><h4 id="9-Get-extra-batteries-or-an-extended-battery-pack"><a href="#9-Get-extra-batteries-or-an-extended-battery-pack" class="headerlink" title="9. Get extra batteries or an extended battery pack"></a>9. Get extra batteries or an extended battery pack</h4><p> Surely this is one of the easiest ways of getting the most out of your GoPro camera. You can just buy a few spare batteries from the 3rd party vendors at a very affordable price so that you don’t have to worry about shooting to your heart’s content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-8-ultimate-free-3d-players-perfect-for-pcmac-users-out-there/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved 8 Ultimate Free 3D Players Perfect for PC/Mac Users Out There</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-podcasters-guide-to-the-10-finest-mic-options/"><u>[New] In 2024, Podcaster's Guide to the 10 Finest Mic Options</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-the-sideways-surprise-decoding-instagram-video-strange-behavior/"><u>[New] The Sideways Surprise Decoding Instagram Video Strange Behavior</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-guidance-to-fix-iphone-autofocus-problems-immediately/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Guidance to Fix iPhone Autofocus Problems Immediately</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-mozilla-revolutionized-screen-splitting-with-ffxp/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How Mozilla Revolutionized Screen Splitting with FFXP</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-snapchats-captivating-boomers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Step-By-Step Guide to Snapchat's Captivating Boomers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-footage-flair-pc-and-mobile-filter-addition/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Footage Flair PC & Mobile Filter Addition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-secret-strategies-to-outshine-with-canva-photos/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Secret Strategies to Outshine with Canva Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-picks-for-the-modern-buyer-advanced-360cams/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top Picks for the Modern Buyer Advanced 360Cams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-vegas-pros-21-landmark-release-a-complete-analysis/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Vegas Pro's '21 Landmark Release - A Complete Analysis</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-transformative-tutorial-turning-vids-on-twitter-into-catchy-animated-memes-gifs/"><u>2024 Approved Transformative Tutorial Turning Vids on Twitter Into Catchy Animated Memes (GIFs)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unpacking-the-basics-an-introductive-guide-to-starting-your-own-tech-review-vlog/"><u>2024 Approved Unpacking the Basics An Introductive Guide to Starting Your Own Tech Review Vlog</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-transfer.techidaily.com/how-to-transfer-photos-from-oneplus-ace-3-to-new-android-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>How to Transfer Photos from OnePlus Ace 3 to New Android? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/1723008533092-minecraft-launch-issues-heres-how-to-get-past-the-loading-hurdle/"><u>Minecraft Launch Issues?

But, if you’ve ever shot any film on a smartphone or a digital camera, you’ve probably observed the colors you see in real life don’t always match up to what you want to see on your screen. In this article, you will grasp how and when to use the color grading process by stylizing the color scheme of your footage and its importance in your everyday film and video projects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-panel-filmora.jpg"                      alt="color grading panel filmora"                ></p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Color-Grading"><a href="#What-is-Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="What is Color Grading?"></a>What is Color Grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the video editing process wherein grading (arranging) colors in a video or film to give them a stylistic look. It is different from Color correction because color correction is the process of correcting (fixing) colors in a video or a film as a way to get them back to what they should look like for your project or output.</p><p>In cinematography, color grading refers to the manipulation of film and video images to create consistent color tones throughout a motion picture. Many filmmakers use a color palette or preset as part of their overall production plan. These palettes represent artistic choices that provide the film with a cohesive general aspect. When film footage does not adequately match these color palettes, directors and colorists use digital color grading tools to change video colors as needed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/origianl-video-color-grading.jpg"                      alt="origianl video color grading"                ></p><p>Color grading and color correction are processes that happen throughout postproduction. One makes the film look more native, and the other stylizes the footage. After the colorist finishes color correction, they can begin grading the film. During color grading, colorists use editing software to formalize the footage, highlighting a movie’s visual tone and ambiance and making it look more cinematic.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/apply-color-grading-to-video.jpg"                      alt="apply color grading to video"                ></p><p>To summarize, Color grading can be used to make both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color grading for artistic purposes to ensure that the film’s carefully curated color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139111/17108" target="_top" id="2139111">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139111" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139111/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-is-Color-Grading-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Color-Grading-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Color Grading Important?"></a>Why is Color Grading Important?</h2><p><strong>Color grading establish a picture’s first impression</strong></p><p>Most images are initially seen as rushed by in one of the infinite scrolls that fill social media or in small thumbnails in galleries. In these circumstances, perfect skin retouching or flawless exposure means very little. Users do not even recognize the image in enough detail with these varieties of an object. Color grading, however, stands out within the condition of these formats. An excellent color-graded image that implores the viewer will drive them to stop and take a closer look. As a photographer, you need support in learning how to grade your ideas so that they will grab viewers’ attention in a fleeting second among the chaotic noise of the digital age.</p><p><strong>It communicates the atmosphere to tune with the scene</strong></p><p>The communication of emotion and story through the lens is one of the most powerful tools a photographer has at their disposal. The grading of a well-graded image can often augment the sense of story within a scene or even completely transform it. Without the grading, an image may look flat, boring, or even disjointed. As a photographer becomes more proficient at grading, he or she can leverage the power of color tone to influence emotional tone within a scene. Grading at this level can transform an unexciting frame into a moment of cinematic magic.</p><p><strong>Color grading encourage a style that can be completely your own</strong></p><p>One of the most intimidating challenges a photographer or vlogger faces is creating a unique style that can result in a brand for their work. Making a visual style that viewers can recognize at a glance can tremendously impact the growth of a photographer’s career. Color grading plays a vital part in that process. Customers will often come to you with a wide range of different photography outputs. By defining a consistent color grading work, you can tie it all into a dense brand that reflects strongly on you and construct a distinctive value that provides you something to sell that only you can offer to people.</p><h2 id="How-to-use-Color-Grading-in-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-use-Color-Grading-in-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to use Color Grading in Wondershare Filmora?"></a>How to use Color Grading in Wondershare Filmora?</h2><p>There are many color grading software available on your Windows PC or Mac.

This reflects the exact allotment of colors throughout a specific image, highlighting the various colors on the screen and the pixels for every color type. When the color histogram points out as “Three Color Histograms,” a specific assignment of the three primary colors (R, B, and G) is reflected.</p><p><strong>White balance</strong></p><p>You can modify the white balance of this video clip here. This allows you to change how intense each color appears in the video. This is important since white balance enables you to depict images realistically. According to the different intensities of the colors, you can get a much-differentiated outcome in terms of realism.</p><p><strong>Vignette</strong></p><p>It is a French word that initially meant the borders of a book. This process allows the center of the image to appear clear and the edges much fader. In other words, if you wish to focus on the middle of the video and blur the rest, you will need this effect. In this way, you can emphasize what is essential and let the other details disappear into the background.</p><p><strong>Color and light</strong></p><p>In the Color and Light section, you can adjust the Exposure, Brightness, Contrast, Saturation, Vibrance, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks.</p><p><strong>3D Look Up Table</strong></p><p>3D LUT is part of the digital middle process. They are mainly used for you to compute how the video will be displayed on various screens and devices. The color space is precisely calculated and mapped to be projected precisely as you would desire. There are, of course, a lot of 3 Dimensional effects allowing you to transform the image of your video as promised.</p><p><strong>HSL</strong></p><p>HSL is the acronym for hue, saturation, and luminosity. It is cylindrical geometry, where you mix the different colors and adjust their intensities to get the accurate mix you are eyeing for in your video. You can select whether you want the video to arise lighter or darker, getting the right mix of colors every time.</p><p>In the HSL section, you can enhance the corresponding color in the video.</p><h5 id="Step3Save-and-export-your-work"><a href="#Step3Save-and-export-your-work" class="headerlink" title="Step3Save and export your work"></a>Step3Save and export your work</h5><p>To view the output, you can compare the video before and after color grading in the A&#x2F;B comparison view. You can eventually save the color grading setting created as a preset and utilize it. If the result is good, click the Export button to upload it to YouTube or Vimeo, Save it as MP4, MKV, WMV, etc., or burn it into DVD.</p><p>Tips: To enter the Advance Color Correction setting, you can select the clip in the timeline and click the Color Tuning icon in the toolbar.</p><p>I hope the mentioned information helps you understand the distinction between Color correction and color grading and creating stunning, excellent videos in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with the Color Tuning tools.</p><p>Overall, Color grading is the process of video editing to have an excellent look to help make a video feel more vigorous and stylistic and can define color assessment. Color correcting is the process of editing a video or film to fix any variances in the color so it can display how the viewers are meant to see it.</p><p><a class="link"

GY-HM170U’s automatic settings might not be the best in the poor light conditions, but the JVC’s 4K camcorder has more than a few manual settings that can help the filmmaker to capture beautiful low-light scenes.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00W0SFQ86/ref=as%5Fli%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&tag=vs-flora-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00W0SFQ86&linkId=e9670f0038c7b731987551a66699f46d" >Check at Amazon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h4 id="17-JVC-GY-HMQ10U-4K"><a href="#17-JVC-GY-HMQ10U-4K" class="headerlink" title="17.

It is the world’s first camcorder capable of recording video at 4 times the resolution of full HD. The GY-HMQ10U’s optical system is what makes this camcorder so unique. The integrated lens is specifically designed to shoot in 4K, with F2.8 10X optical zoom. The GY-HMQ10U is smaller and more compact than most professional cameras on the market, which makes it a perfect companion on your journeys.</p><hr><h4 id="18-JVC-GY-HM200-4K"><a href="#18-JVC-GY-HM200-4K" class="headerlink" title="18.

The 12X F1.2 - 3.5 lens produces sharp images that grab the viewer’s attention.

Easy to take with"></a>1. Easy to take with</h4><p>Most camcorders available on the market today are easy to carry around, so when buying a 4K camcorder you should think about how easy the model you are planning on buying is to carry around. Also, keep in mind that lightweight cameras are more difficult to hold still.</p><h4 id="2-Wide-lens-and-large-sensors"><a href="#2-Wide-lens-and-large-sensors" class="headerlink" title="2. Wide lens and large sensors"></a>2. Wide lens and large sensors</h4><p>The sensor of a camera is perhaps its most important part. The 1-inch sensor pretty much enables you to record video in any light conditions. Most of the 4K camcorders have integrated wide angle lenses, but it is important to find out what the lens on your camcorder can and cannot do.</p><h4 id="3-Built-in-viewfinder"><a href="#3-Built-in-viewfinder" class="headerlink" title="3. Built-in viewfinder"></a>3. Built-in viewfinder</h4><p>As great as camera displays are, they are not always reliable and you can’t always be sure that the images you are seeing on the display are going to look like that once you transfer them onto your hard drive. A good viewfinder can help you to make sure that your videos are not overexposed or underexposed and that your footage is always in focus.</p><h4 id="4-Optical-Zoom"><a href="#4-Optical-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="4. Optical Zoom"></a>4. Optical Zoom</h4><p>Using a camera often means that you want to record something that is not near you. Sometimes you might want to film only a detail, but without a proper lens, this task is impossible. 4K camcorders do not have interchangeable lenses which is why an optical zoom can be crucial in situations when you want to record something that is out of your reach. Most 4K camcorders also have a digital zoom, but digital zoom reduces the picture quality and it is best to avoid using it.</p><h4 id="5-Image-stabilization"><a href="#5-Image-stabilization" class="headerlink" title="5. Image stabilization"></a>5. Image stabilization</h4><p>Capturing motion isn’t as easy as it sounds. Moving objects tend to create a blur, which is why Image stabilization techniques are such an important factor that determines the quality of any camera. Camera shake can result in unusable footage and if you are looking to buy a 4K camcorder make sure that the camera you wish to purchase has a superb Image stabilization.</p><h4 id="6-External-Microphone-Jack"><a href="#6-External-Microphone-Jack" class="headerlink" title="6. External Microphone Jack"></a>6. External Microphone Jack</h4><p>Internal camera sound is often too terrible to be used in the post-production. If you’d like to record professional sound for your videos make sure that the 4K camcorder has at least one XLR jack.</p><h4 id="7-Night-Vision"><a href="#7-Night-Vision" class="headerlink" title="7. Night Vision"></a>7. Night Vision</h4><p>The camera’s ability to record in the low-light conditions is not important to all users, but professionals sometimes have no other choice, but to record in terrible light conditions. Night Vision feature is important if you are planning on recording concerts or any other events that are not perfectly lit.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105869/7443" target="_top" id="2105869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-enjoy-youtube-music-anytime-with-these-23-essential-no-cost-audio-extractors/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Enjoy YouTube Music Anytime with These 23 Essential, No-Cost Audio Extractors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-8-best-5k-monitors-for-you/"><u>[New] In 2024, 8 Best 5K Monitors for You</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-slow-it-down-techniques-to-improve-your-slow-motion-photography-skills-for-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[New] Slow It Down Techniques to Improve Your Slow Motion Photography Skills for Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-change-voice-on-ps5ps4-software-and-hardware-solutions-here/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved How to Change Voice on PS5/PS4?

Tap on the white button at the left bottom corner of the screen and a high resolution snapshot is automatically saved in the Camera Roll folder beside the recorded video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/still-camera.JPG"                      alt="capture still image"                ></p><p><strong>Supported Slow</strong> - Mo Shooting Modes- Do you know the slow motion recording modes supported by iPhone?</p><p>iPhone 5s only can capture 720p at 120 FPS. iPhone 6&#x2F;6 Plus&#x2F;6s&#x2F;6s Plus, iPhone 7&#x2F;7 Plus can capture 720p at 240 FPS. iPhone 8&#x2F;8 Plus and iPhone X can even capture 1080p HD at 240 FPS.</p><p><strong>Space used by slo-mo video</strong> - It is vital to know that the iPhone 5s onwards iOS devices record slow motion video at 120 frames per second (fps). If you record slow motion video at higher frame rates, it takes lesser space than 120fps video.</p><p>The slo-mo video recorded at 1080p resolution at 120 fps uses approximately 375 MB per minute storage space and slow motion video iPhone resolution of 720p at 240 fps uses approximately 300 MB per minute.</p><p><strong>Is slow motion video from normal video possible</strong> - A higher frame rate than normal is required to record a slow motion video., Playing a slow motion video to normal is possible but the reverse is impossible. You get a jerky video with frames jumping here and there when you try to watch a slow motion video from normal. It appears as a series of still snapshots rather than a constant video.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148643/16836" target="_top" id="2148643">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148643" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="75"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148643/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Normal-Speed-Video-to-Slow-Motion"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Normal-Speed-Video-to-Slow-Motion" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion"></a>Part 2: How to Change Normal Speed Video to Slow Motion</h2><p>If you’ve recorded a video on iPhone in normal speed and want to turn it into a slow-motion video, or if you can’t record a slow-motion video with your iPhone, you can use some third-party apps to convert them to slow motion videos.

But there aren’t many ways to customize it. Additionally, there are a lot of problems with the commercials, the little selection of templates, and the brief movie length. On the other hand, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers more advanced tools than Pixiz online slideshow maker to create more attractive and advanced slideshows or photo videos.

But there aren’t many ways to customize it. Additionally, there are a lot of problems with the commercials, the little selection of templates, and the brief movie length. On the other hand, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> offers more advanced tools than Pixiz online slideshow maker to create more attractive and advanced slideshows or photo videos. However, you must buy the premium version to unlock its full potential and remove the watermark. I hope you’ll find this article helpful.

The pixel response is 14 ms. Users can adjust settings for all important functionalities like sharpness, contrast and brightness.

This IPS panel shows very impressive performance for grayscale test where every shade ranging between light and dark was presented smoothly so that viewers can enjoy impressive display. You will definitely love its viewing angle performance as it does not cause any decay in information on extreme bottom, side or top ranges. Other than this, HP Envy works with AMD’s FreeSync technology that improves performance over tearing issue. Motion blur is perfectly adjusted with its slow 14 ms pixel response whereas input lag for display is 41.1 ms.</p><h4 id="3-FreeSync-Compatibility"><a href="#3-FreeSync-Compatibility" class="headerlink" title="3. FreeSync Compatibility"></a>3. FreeSync Compatibility</h4><p> With lots of incredible technology additions, this monitor also has AMD’s FreeSync ability. This feature is really useful for gamers who need consistent performance at 60Hz. However, this feature finds limited application here because most of the latest mobile units cannot handle 4K games with ease. As mobile units are designed to be energy efficient, thin and portable so they are not able to carry AMD’s Radeon Graphic Processor. However, IGPs designed with Intel processor can handle this feature well but they do not allow games with FreeSync accepted frame rates.</p><h4 id="4-Responsiveness"><a href="#4-Responsiveness" class="headerlink" title="4. Responsiveness"></a>4. Responsiveness</h4><p> As we already know that HP Envy is designed with FreeSync technology but at the same time it offers 14ms response time, this rating shows little disturbance for motion blur adjustment. Also, the input lag was observed to be 41.1 ms. This monitor consumes about 37 watts power at natural color temperature mode but it does not possess ECO power saving ability.</p><p> Responsiveness matters a lot for gamers because they cannot take a chance to allow frames lag behind even by single second. Especially in the person shooting games and latest action games, you cannot compromise for delay in display of details on screen.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027195/19272" target="_top" id="2027195">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027195" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027195/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> In case if you are searching for a large screen elegant UHD monitor then HP Envy is one of the best choices. This monitor delivers stunning image quality with wide viewing angle setup and acceptable color accuracy range. It also possesses AMD FreeSync technology but still this monitor is not recommended for professional gamers.

There are numerous features available on WhatsApp. However, today we will discuss an essential topic regarding WhatsApp: <strong>how you can send a voice message or recorded audio on WhatsApp</strong>. This guide will briefly examine the methods of <strong>sending voice messages</strong> and <strong>audio recording</strong> over WhatsApp on iOS or Android.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-send-a-voice-message-on-WhatsApp"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-send-a-voice-message-on-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

So both iOS and Android users can follow up on these steps:</p><ol><li>Press and hold the voice recorder button on the right side to record the voice message. However, a more effective way is to swipe up the voice recorder button to lock it. Now you can easily record it without holding the button.</li><li>There are three more options appear at the bottom:</li></ol><ul><li><strong>The Delete button</strong> can used to delete the voice you’ve just recorded. However, if you haven’t locked the recorder button, you can delete the message by sliding it to the left.</li><li><strong>The pause button</strong> can help you in pausing the recording.</li><li><strong>The send button</strong> will send your recorded voice message.</li></ul><ol><li>Before sending, you can also check your recorded voice by clicking the pause button, and then you have the option to play the voice.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/whatsapp-voice-messages-1.jpg"                      alt="clicking the pause button"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/whatsapp-voice-messages-2.jpg"                      alt="play the voice"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="2127886">                    <video width="576" height="1024" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2127886">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/2127886.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Funicoeye.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F2127886%2F18498'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2127886/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-send-recorded-audio-on-WhatsApp"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-send-recorded-audio-on-WhatsApp" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Researching all the numerous possibilities and choosing the appropriate service for you can be a mammoth process, leaving many people merely choosing one of the major brands, like Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive. The regular SSD or hard drive can no longer suffice with the quantity of data that needs to be stored, so the only option is to subscribe to a possible cloud storage service. The best way to store data in the cloud is through cloud storage, accessed from any location and device.</p><p>We’ve evaluated all the various cloud storage out there and put up this cloud storage comparison to make the task simpler. If you want to save money on storage, <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> is essential when choosing the best cloud storage service provider.</p><p>So, read on as we discuss <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> below:</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison"><a href="#Part-1-Cloud-Storage-Pricing-Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison"></a>Part 1: Cloud Storage Pricing Comparison</h2><p>Here is a table comparing top cloud storage providers’ free storage space and their <strong>cloud storage pricing comparison</strong>.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Cloud Storage Providers</th><th>Free Storage</th><th>Monthly Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apple iCloud</td><td>5GB</td><td>50GB - $1200GB - $32TB - $10</td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td>15GB</td><td>100GB - $7.49250GB - $10500GB - $18.95</td></tr><tr><td>Amazon</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB - $21TB - $7 2TB - $12</td></tr><tr><td>Microsoft</td><td>5GB</td><td>100GB of storage for $2 per month or $20 annually</td></tr><tr><td>Dropbox</td><td>2GB</td><td>Plus: 2TB - $10Family: 2TB - $17.</td></tr><tr><td>pCloud</td><td>10GB</td><td>500GB - $50 a year2TB - $100 a year10TB - Custom</td></tr><tr><td>Sync.com</td><td>5GB</td><td>1TB - $6Unlimited - $15</td></tr><tr><td>Icedrive</td><td>10GB</td><td>150GB - $1.671TB - $4.175TB - $15</td></tr></tbody></table><p>However, Google Drive and Photos are already fine if you don’t wish to invest much money. For example, you can use Google Photos to store photos in the cloud.</p><p>The security and privacy of cloud services are crucial, correct storage capacity and device compatibility.</p><p>If security is your top priority, choose Sync.com, IceDrive, and pCloud. They are the most robust encryption and authentication system for cloud storage.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Price-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Price Recommendations"></a>Part 2: Best Price Recommendations</h2><p>Here we recommend the cloud storage services with the best prices in three categories.</p><h3 id="1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage"><a href="#1-Best-price-of-lifetime-license-cloud-storage" class="headerlink" title="1.

The individual plans are as follows:</p><ul><li>500 GB of Premium storage costs $50.</li><li>2 TB of storage for Premium Plus costs $100.</li><li>10 TB storage for Custom storage.</li></ul><p><em><strong># Icedrive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-2.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>You can choose between monthly, annual, and lifetime subscriptions with Icedrive. Each offers three different cloud storage options (from the monthly subscription).</p><p>Here are the monthly <strong>cloud storage pricing</strong> packages.</p><ul><li>Lite: 150 GB of storage and 250 GB of bandwidth per month for $1.67</li><li>Pro: 1 TB of storage and 2 TB of bandwidth per month for $4.17.</li><li>Pro+: 5 TB of storage and 8 TB of monthly bandwidth per month for $15.</li></ul><p>Creating an account will grant you free access to 10 TB of storage!

Best price of unlimited cloud storage service</h3><p>For the best <strong>cloud storage prices</strong> for unlimited storage, here is a list of a few recommended cloud storage services.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-3.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>The service offers one of the industry’s most excellent versioning systems, broad file-sharing functionality, outstanding security, and privacy.</p><p>Sync.com offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:</p><ul><li>Teams Standard Plan for 1TB of storage space costs $6 per month, billed annually</li><li>Teams Unlimited Plan for Unlimited storage space costs $15 per month, billed annually.</li><li>Enterprise plan – Custom pricing</li></ul><p><em><strong># Dropbox</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-4.JPG"                      alt="dropbox"                ></p><p>It established numerous file-sharing and syncing trends currently refined. Dropbox first used the sync-folder model, and this version is among the finest.</p><p>Dropbox offers two plans for unlimited cloud storage service:</p><ul><li>The Dropbox Plus plan for 2TB of storage space costs $10 monthly</li><li>The Dropbox Family Plan for 2TB storage space costs $17 monthly</li></ul><h3 id="3-Overall-cheapest-cloud-storage-service"><a href="#3-Overall-cheapest-cloud-storage-service" class="headerlink" title="3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service"></a>3. Overall cheapest cloud storage service</h3><p>You can use the following cloud service providers for the cheapest cloud storage pricing.</p><p><em><strong># Sync.com</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-5.JPG"                      alt="sync.com"                ></p><p>Sync.com comes out on top of our list of the best cloud storage options because the company emphasizes data protection while maintaining a high functionality level for more skilled users. The fact that it is encrypted from end to end implies that both its upload and download rates are rather sluggish. Because this is a zero-knowledge service, nobody but you will be able to decrypt your data. Even though there are no monthly plans available, the price of the service is relatively reasonable, which is a plus given the high level of protection it provides; yet, this absence may be inconvenient for specific customers.</p><p><strong>Pricing:</strong> 5GB for free, 1TB - $6; and Unlimited - $15</p><p><em><strong># IceDrive</strong></em></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/cloud-storage-pricing-6.JPG"                      alt="icedrive"                ></p><p>IceDrive, a cloud storage newcomer in the United Kingdom, may not yet have the power and polish of the leading competitors. Still, the firm already has more than enough cool features to take a cautious look. Users of Windows may navigate their storage space using Explorer, for instance, and do tasks such as relocating, renaming, opening, and editing files, just as if they were working on a local disk.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Compact-Movie-Story-Proposal"><a href="#Compact-Movie-Story-Proposal" class="headerlink" title="Compact Movie Story Proposal"></a>Compact Movie Story Proposal</h2><p>Short films are becoming more and more popular with seasoned filmmakers, breakout filmmakers, and students alike. Search on YouTube and you’ll find thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of short film examples. But what makes for a good short <a class="link"   href="https://blog.celtx.com/write-the-script-5-basic-steps/" >film script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? How can you make it stand out from the crowd?</p><p>Today, we look at seven important aspects of a great short film script and how you can improve yours. Can you put these into practice when writing your next script?</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts"><a href="#Part-1-7-tips-for-improving-short-film-scripts" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts"></a>Part 1. 7 tips for improving short film scripts</h2><p>There’s never been a better time to learn the craft of writing short film scripts. Interest and access to creating and viewing short films and series episodes have exploded worldwide, both on television and on the web. A great short film can also open doors for you into the film industry, as Barry Jenkins discovered with his great screenplay for the short film My Josephine, which I wrote in my screenwriting class at Florida State University.</p><p>But writing a successful short script is not easy. It requires the craft and concentration of a medieval artist carving scenes into walnut. So here are seven tips for creating a short script.</p><h3 id="1-Storyline"><a href="#1-Storyline" class="headerlink" title="1. Storyline"></a>1. Storyline</h3><p>This is always, always, the number one problem for my screenwriting students. They come up with big story ideas, often feature screenplay ideas, but quickly find that their idea doesn’t fit or work in short form. The result is what I call “narrative cramming.” The story can’t breathe. So, you need an idea that is small, specific, and significant to your main character.</p><p><strong><em>My Josephine</em></strong> was inspired by “an image of two people’s legs hanging over a table in my head,” according to Barry Jenkins. I saw them, young and intimate, working the night shift in a 24-hour laundry.” Even with this small, simple, and significant image as a starting point for a short script, Barry struggled to find a story in six pages that he could tell well. He attempted to include the murder in the Laundromat at one point, which resulted in, yes, narrative cramming. Barry rewrote the script a year later and “made it as simple as I could as a writer,” he told me. I was so moved by his transcript that I only wrote three words in the script – “Beautiful and gentle”. Just like his beautiful film.</p><h3 id="2-Characterization"><a href="#2-Characterization" class="headerlink" title="2. Characterization"></a>2. Characterization</h3><p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><h3 id="3-An-independent-story"><a href="#3-An-independent-story" class="headerlink" title="3. An independent story"></a>3. An independent story</h3><p>It’s also a useful way to think of the script as an energy system, as William Gibson brilliantly says in Shakespeare’s play. An energy system begins with an Inciting Incident - a significant event&#x2F;discovery that unleashes the energy system - and ends with a Climax - the moment when the story’s outcome is known, and the energy system ends. Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><h3 id="4-Conflict"><a href="#4-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="4. Conflict"></a>4. Conflict</h3><p>Conflict is every point of opposition between two forces (physical or intellectual), as well as the consequences of this opposition - all in full view of what can be seen on the screen, whether through cinema, television, or devices.</p><p>Screenwriters can’t convey conflict with background and inner thoughts or explanations of inner thoughts—that’s literary conflict.</p><p>Instead, screenwriters are tasked with presenting the conflict on screen through scene descriptions, character actions and reactions, and dialogue.

So, it’s helpful to think of your scenes as the time and place where a significant moment of change will occur, throwing your script into the next scene and moving your story forward. That is your purpose when you write a scene, to dramatize the moment (or moments) of change. That’s what matters. I like to think of a scene as an oyster and a moment of change as a pearl. Then cut to your scenes as close to the moment of change as possible and exit as soon as possible.</p><p>I got it, really got it, as a young playwright when the Actors Theater of Louisville commissioned me to write a ten-minute play. And I did—in six scenes that I hit late and left early, each with a small but significant moment of change that moved the story into the next scene. “A tender and effortless glissando that gracefully stretches from moment to wistful moment,” as The Los Angeles Times put it in my all-time favorite review.</p><h3 id="7-Ending"><a href="#7-Ending" class="headerlink" title="7.

Characterization"></a>2. Characterization</h3><p>Writing compelling short scripts requires what Thornton Wilder called “shortcuts to the imagination.” And knowing what your main character wants in your story is the most important shortcut to understanding and discovering who your main character is. So, give your main character a desire or yearning for something that matters deeply to her. Then let your story flow from your character’s efforts to achieve that wish. The best stories, short or long, are about the human heart.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1657395/16446" target="_top" id="1657395">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1657395" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657395/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-An-independent-story-1"><a href="#3-An-independent-story-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

An energy system begins with an Inciting Incident - a significant event&#x2F;discovery that unleashes the energy system - and ends with a Climax - the moment when the story’s outcome is known, and the energy system ends. Given the limited number of pages available in your short script, it’s essential that your inciting incident appears on the first page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/short-film-script-example-1.jpg"                      alt="an independent story"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123509/26400" target="_top" id="2123509">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2123509" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123509/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Conflict-1"><a href="#4-Conflict-1" class="headerlink" title="4.

Now, both on your phone and computer, you can effortlessly book, join, manage, and personalize Zoom in Gmail straight from Gmail and Google Calendar. An add-on for Gmail and Calendar has been released as a result of a collaboration between Zoom and Google. Users of Google Calendar have the option of utilizing Google Meet, the company’s own online meeting tool. Although many people prefer Zoom, that is excellent. For Google Calendar and Zoom to work together effectively, all you need to do is download and install a free app. Here, we’ll go through how to plan meetings using Gmail and Calendar with the Zoom add-on.</p><p>Having a built-in option for scheduling Zoom in Gmail meetings is crucial for individuals who often conduct business through video-based meetings. There are a few methods to link Zoom with Google Calendar if you use both services. With only one click thanks to this connection, you can include a Zoom meeting in a calendar invitation. The default choice for meetings is Google’s video conferencing service, Google Meet. This does not preclude you from using Zoom. To make it similarly frictionless, all you have to do is install a free app. By installing an add-on from the Google Workspace Marketplace, you may quickly do this operation if you use Zoom as your video-conference platform and utilize Google Calendar. When your Zoom meeting times are shown in the Google Calendar app, it is quite convenient. After that, you may get reminders and invite others. How to incorporate Zoom in Gmail is covered in this article. This is how you integrate Zoom with Google Calendar.</p><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">Calendar Link Addition</a></li><li><a href="#part3-2">Make a Video Recording of the Call</a></li><li><a href="#part3-3">Create Meeting Template</a></li></ol><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Part-1-Install-Zoom-Add-On-for-Google-Account"><a href="#Part-1-Install-Zoom-Add-On-for-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Install Zoom Add-On for Google Account"></a>Part 1. Install Zoom Add-On for Google Account</h2><p>Using the “Zoom for Gmail” add-on, which connects your Gmail account with Zoom, you may activate Zoom meetings on Gmail. The default choice for meetings is Google’s video conferencing service, Google Meet. To make it similarly frictionless, all you have to do is install a free app. When you include a Zoom meeting in your calendar invitation, all participants may join the meeting by simply clicking the meeting’s details and then clicking again. With this add-on, you may use Gmail’s web client’s collaboration capabilities to initiate and plan Zoom sessions. Visit the Google Workspace store to add Zoom to your G-suite account. How to install this on your account is provided here. You may achieve this by doing the actions listed below:</p><p><strong>Steps to Install Zoom for Gmail</strong></p><p>The procedures for installing the Zoom for G Suite plugin are as follows:</p><h5 id="Step1Visit-the-Google-Workplace-Marketplace"><a href="#Step1Visit-the-Google-Workplace-Marketplace" class="headerlink" title="Step1Visit the Google Workplace Marketplace"></a>Step1Visit the Google Workplace Marketplace</h5><p>Install the Zoom for Gmail add-on via the G Suite Marketplace as your first step. Click Install, continue, and then Allow to get started (when giving Zoom access to your Google account).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-for-gmail.jpg"                      alt="zoom for gmail"                ></p><h5 id="Step2Press-“Install”"><a href="#Step2Press-“Install”" class="headerlink" title="Step2Press “Install”"></a>Step2Press “Install”</h5><p>There is no need to log into Zoom or look through emails to get access. Both choices may be used for free. You can quickly book, join, and manage Zoom meetings from the mobile or desktop versions of your personal Gmail and Google Calendar by using the Zoom for G-Suite add-on. You’ll get a popup on your screen stating “Zoom for Gmail has been installed” when the installation is complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-zoom-for-gmail.jpg"                      alt="install zoom for gmail"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Log-into-your-own-Google-Account"><a href="#Step3Log-into-your-own-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Step3Log into your own Google Account"></a>Step3Log into your own Google Account</h5><p>Launch your web browser and open Gmail.

How to start a meeting from Zoom for Gmail"></a>Part 2. How to start a meeting from Zoom for Gmail</h2><p>G Suite and Zoom may be integrated in both ways. Therefore, each meeting you schedule on Zoom will have an invite link that is instantly posted to your Google Calendar. Install it after logging out of all other Google accounts and signing into the one you wish to add it to. Another feature of the Zoom for Gmail add-on is the ability to book a Zoom conference directly from Gmail. The meeting subject will automatically be pulled from the email subject line into the Google Calendar event. Simply login into Gmail in your browser and start a new email message to begin organizing Zoom meetings. Here’s how to set up a Zoom meeting on your Google Calendar and invite participants:</p><p><strong>Steps to Use Zoom for Gmail</strong></p><p>Step1 Install the “Zoom for G-Suite” plugin, that is free, from the official G-Suite store after logging into your Google account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-zoom-for-gsuite.jpg"                      alt="install zoom for gsuite"                ></p><p>To get install rights if you are using an enterprise account, get in touch with your IT administrator. A lot of rights, including complete access to your whole contact list, are also required by the add-on. Skip this technique and look at Method 2, which does not need the add-on, if that makes you uncomfortable.</p><p>Step2 Now open Google Calendar, and on the right side of the window, locate the Zoom symbol. To log into your Zoom account using the add-on, click the icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="zoom in google calendar"                ></p><p>Step3 Turn on “Pre-approve” and adhere to the on-screen instructions to provide the app access to your Google account information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-pre-approve.jpg"                      alt="enable pre approve"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037319/7443" target="_top" id="2037319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037319/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step4 Next, check for the “Add Conferencing” box when creating a new Google Calendar event. Then, pick “Zoom Meeting” from the list of possibilities by clicking on the drop-down menu. At the bottom, click “Preserve” to save your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-conference-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="add conference google calendar"                ></p><p>Step5 The Meeting ID, password, and passcode will now be automatically filled in by the add-on in the Calendar event. Additionally, it will provide a link with joining instructions, which should be helpful for anyone who are unfamiliar with Zoom. You may now invite people to the meeting by clicking on the freshly created event in Google Calendar and using the “Add Guests” section. Finally, choose the “envelope” symbol to send guests an email invitation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-guests-zoom-meeting.jpg"                      alt="add guests zoom meeting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Use-Zoom-for-Gmail"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Use-Zoom-for-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tips to Use Zoom for Gmail"></a>Part 3. Tips to Use Zoom for Gmail</h2><p>Two of the most popular productivity tools are Zoom and G Suite, which are utilized by both businesses and individuals. Users can simply book Zoom meetings from inside Google Calendar and invite friends, family, and coworkers to participate thanks to the connectivity between the two.</p><h3 id="Calendar-Link-Addition"><a href="#Calendar-Link-Addition" class="headerlink" title="Calendar Link Addition"></a>Calendar Link Addition</h3><p>Without the add-on, you may still include a link to a Zoom meeting in a Google Calendar event. Because the add-on requests a ton of permissions, including full access to your complete contact list, it is really the most private alternative. Keep in mind, too, that using the manual way will not sync your meetings between Zoom and Calendar for you. If you’re okay with that, the following instructions will show you how to add a Zoom invite link to Google Calendar without the add-on:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/calendar-link-addition-meeting.jpg"                      alt="calendar link addition meeting"                ></p><ul><li>Create a new meeting by using the Zoom client on your PC (or Android or iOS phone). Then, on the Meetings page, select the “Copy Invitation” option.</li><li>Open a web browser and log in to Google. After that, enter Google Calendar and manually paste the meeting details into the “Notes” area at the bottom before adding the Zoom invite link. Finally, choose “Save.” As previously mentioned, you may now use the email link to add guests and send invitations.</li><li>After accepting the invitation, the participants will see the meeting link in their Google Calendar and be able to join by clicking the link or the “Join Zoom Meeting” option.</li></ul><h3 id="Make-a-Video-Recording-of-the-Call"><a href="#Make-a-Video-Recording-of-the-Call" class="headerlink" title="Make a Video Recording of the Call"></a>Make a Video Recording of the Call</h3><p>Zoom’s web conferencing call recording as video capability is useful for sharing the conference with individuals who may have missed it or for evaluating the conversation. You must choose either the local or cloud option while recording. Local refers to storing the video file on your own devices, such as your computer or an external storage device.</p><p>Use the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> screen recorder for the much simpler experience. With the help of the Filmora screen recorder, users may simultaneously record their screen and camera as well as the audio from their system and microphone.
