There are so many software tools available onpne to complete this task and <a class="link"   href="https://www.pscp.tv/" >Periscope <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the easier platforms out of this big pst. It assists users to pve stream their content directly from phone. Using Periscope, you can easily stay connected with whole world and can have continuous updates about what is happening around. The best thing to know about Periscope is that it works perfectly on Android as well as iOS platform.</p><h2 id="Pros-of-Periscope"><a href="#Pros-of-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="Pros of Periscope"></a>Pros of Periscope</h2><p> 1. One of the biggest benefits of Periscope pve streaming tool is its super simple and highly intuitive design that makes everything easier for novice users. Simply download your apppcation and start broadcasting with one cpck access.</p><p> 2. You need not to mess with setup, complex wirings and there is no need to access any speciapzed equipment as well as coding is not required. Simply plug and start playing.</p><p> 3. You will be glad to know that Periscope is available for free with all impressive features.</p><p> 4. When you find opportunity to work on streaming apps that are popular, it naturally makes your sessions more interactive. Periscope app is well recognised among pve streamers and a large community is connected to it. Instead of just staying dependent upon advertisements or brand management, this apppcation has something unique to offer with more authentic content.</p><p> 5. When you start setting your pve broadcasting video title then you can also choose active share options to send it on Twitter platform, make some easy settings about who is allowed to comment on your videos and users can also activate the location information. This active location sharing mode allows users to find viewers from nearby locapty and hence more interactions can be boosted.</p><p> 6. Periscope also provides abipty to save the broadcasts so that they can be easily accessed in near future. Over most of platforms, the work on your broadcast pst gets automatically removed after 24 hours but Periscope value your efforts and give you opportunity to save your creative content.</p><h2 id="Cons-of-Periscope"><a href="#Cons-of-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="Cons of Periscope"></a>Cons of Periscope</h2><p> 1. As we already discussed, this apppcation is too simple, being an advantage on one side for beginners, it is also the biggest con for professionals. This extremely simple platform lacks in advanced settings and becomes restricted to casual use only. It cannot satisfy needs of demanding users.</p><p> 2. When we talk about pve streaming then it is pke a business, many streamers make huge money from their channels but this option is not accessible with Periscope because it does not allow monetization. It does not entertain pay per view type sales, ads or any kind of subscriptions and it leads to major drawback if you consider your streaming career as a business.</p><p> 3. This apppcation provides very pmited functionapty for pve streaming. As per default settings, everything stays pubpc whereas the only control option is to ban users for once or allow broadcast sharing with targeted audience.</p><p> 4. If you are searching for followers then it is really very difficult to know whether user is onpne or not. You cannot even get information about whether these profiles are active or are unresponsive from long time.</p><p> 5. It does not allow interaction for broadcast downloads, that is really sad.</p><p> 6. The only interaction supported by Periscope is with twitter platform, it does not allow users to share content on other popular social media platforms.</p><p> 7. Periscope is too much caring about its branding; users need to be inside app in order to watch the stream or to upload a pve stream. That means most of the major aspects are under the control of apppcation and users need to follow them. Users cannot even adjust the colour streams for their broadcasts.</p><p> 8. Video quapty is not that good.</p><p> 9. It also pmits the quapty of audio information.</p><p> 10. Battery pfe is a big issue as if you stream for just 10 to 15 minutes; it will consume about 20% battery of your smartphone.</p><h2 id="How-to-Broadcast-on-Periscope"><a href="#How-to-Broadcast-on-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="How to Broadcast on Periscope?"></a>How to Broadcast on Periscope?</h2><p> Follow these simple steps to complete your broadcasting task:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create your Periscope account and then go to broadcast tab using your iPhone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Then enter title for your broadcast so that viewers can avail information about what you are going to share.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  There are four icons on apppcation window right above the start broadcast button, they can be used to manage location settings, tweets, to create restrictions over chat and to broadcast private content.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Adjusting-YouTube-Video-Scale-Effectively"><a href="#Adjusting-YouTube-Video-Scale-Effectively" class="headerlink" title="Adjusting YouTube Video Scale Effectively"></a>Adjusting YouTube Video Scale Effectively</h2><p>YouTube is undoubtedly the most popular online video streaming platform. Irrespectively of its extreme popularity, the platform still lacks certain basic options that are essential for the convenience of the users. For example, you are watching a YouTube video, and you notice something interesting and curious in the background of the subject. You will want to zoom into that portion of the video so that the minute details become visible. However, there is no built-in zoom YouTube video option available.</p><p>The requirement of zooming into YouTube videos is quite basic, and you will definitely need it at some point. You need to zoom videos to magnify and read texts as well as pay attention to details. In spite of YouTube video zoom option not available, there are several ways possible through which you can zoom into any YouTube videos conveniently. We will illustrate all the ways with detailed steps for complete understanding.</p><h2 id="Way-1-Use-Browser-Zoom-Feature"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Browser-Zoom-Feature" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Use Browser Zoom Feature"></a>Way 1. Use Browser Zoom Feature</h2><p>If you are viewing YouTube videos from your web browser on your computer or smartphone, you can easily zoom into the video. This is because every web browser has the built-in option for zooming the browser window. As the browser window zooms in, the YouTube video playing in the browser will also zoom in. You have to then scroll and place the YouTube video in the center of the browser window for the best result. Here are the steps on how to zoom in YouTube using browser Zoom feature.</p><p>Step1Open your web browser and visit the YouTube website. Play the desired video.</p><p>Step2Click on the three-dot icon at the top-right corner, and you will see a drop-down menu.</p><p>Step3Go to Zoom option and click on “+” to zoom the browser window and thereby, zooming on YouTube video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-youtube-1.jpg"                      alt="browser zoom youtube video"                ></p><p>Play the video in theatre mode for a better zooming result. Alternatively, you can press Ctrl and “+” keys together to zoom in by percentage.</p><p>When you zoom in on YouTube video using browser zoom feature, the zooming is not very accurate because it does not actually zoom the focused part of the video. The zooming is uniform and you have to place the video on the browser window for the zoom effect to be somewhat effective.</p><h2 id="Way-2-Zoom-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Way-2-Zoom-YouTube-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Way 2.

What better way to do that than Photoshop?</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" >Photoshop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Adobe is a premium-level image and graphics editor. Photoshop has held the gold standard for editing graphics and images for years. It is undoubtedly the best photo background editor app you can find to get your job done. With its precise tools and a sleek interface, it is relatively easy to insert your photo and edit background image.</p><p>Here is how you can edit and replace your image background in Photoshop:</p><p>Step 1: Select your Subject</p><p>Add your image to the interface of the program. From the toolbar on the left, tap the “Quick Selection” tool. Now drag the area of the image you want to select using the brush. You can hold the “Alt” key and drag the unwanted areas to remove them from the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-1.jpg"                      alt="use quick selection tool"                ></p><p>Step 2: Mask your Selection</p><p>Go to the options bar present at the top. Tap on “Select and Mask” to convert your selection into a mask. From the “Properties” panel, tap “View Mode” to determine how you want to see your selection. “Overlay” works best in general.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-2.jpg"                      alt="select the view mode"                ></p><p>Step 3: Polish the Edges</p><p>You can now further refine your selected part using the different tools offered by Photoshop. Use the “Quick Selection” tool to add or remove large areas. For hair and soft edges, you can use the “Refine Edge Brush” tool. The “Lasso&#x2F;Polygonal Lasso” tool can help manually draw areas for your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-3.jpg"                      alt="edit the image edges"                ></p><p>Step 4: Remove Residual Colors</p><p>From the panel at the right, select “Output Settings.” Check the box next to “Decontaminate Colors” to get rid of any leftover color fringe from your foreground. From “Output,” you now need to add a new layer by clicking on “New Layer with Layer Mask.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-4.jpg"                      alt="remove the selected color"                ></p><p>Step 5: Add a New Background</p><p>You can now paste the image you wish to add as a background for your photo. Position your image on the layer below the one with your foreground. You can resize your background image if required by selecting the “Free Transform” tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-5.jpg"                      alt="add new picture background"                ></p><p>Step 6: Fix the Colors</p><p>To blend the colors of your two images, select your foreground layer. Now go to “Image” and open “Adjustments.” From here, launch the “Match Color” popup window. Navigate to “Source” and select your image. From the “Layer” option, choose the layer you want to fix.</p><p>Tick the “Neutralize” box and adjust the “Luminance” and “Intensity” until you meet your requirements. You are all done now! Click “OK” and save your newly edited image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-6.jpg"                      alt="fix the image colors"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Blur-Photo-Background"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Blur-Photo-Background" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Blur Photo Background?"></a>Part 2: How to Blur Photo Background?</h2><p>A blurred background helps bring your image into focus.

Here are the steps for that:</p><p>Step 1: Isolate Subject</p><p>Isolate your subject on a separate layer by accessing the “Quick Selection” tool and clicking on the “Select Subject” button. You can use the “Lasso” tool to refine your selection. Click on “Select and Mask” and select the “Black and White View.” Now, choose the output to “New Layer with Layer Mask.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-7.jpg"                      alt="change the output"                ></p><p>Step 2: Expand the Selection</p><p>Hold the “CTRL” key and select your layer mask.

You can also control the intensity of the blur from the slider present on the right. Click “OK” and save your image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-9.jpg"                      alt="confirm blur settings"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Remove-Photo-Background"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Remove-Photo-Background" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Remove Photo Background?"></a>Part 3: How to Remove Photo Background?</h2><p>Want to remove the background from your image?

What better way to do that than Photoshop?</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html" >Photoshop <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Adobe is a premium-level image and graphics editor. Photoshop has held the gold standard for editing graphics and images for years. It is undoubtedly the best photo background editor app you can find to get your job done. With its precise tools and a sleek interface, it is relatively easy to insert your photo and edit background image.</p><p>Here is how you can edit and replace your image background in Photoshop:</p><p>Step 1: Select your Subject</p><p>Add your image to the interface of the program. From the toolbar on the left, tap the “Quick Selection” tool. Now drag the area of the image you want to select using the brush. You can hold the “Alt” key and drag the unwanted areas to remove them from the selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-1.jpg"                      alt="use quick selection tool"                ></p><p>Step 2: Mask your Selection</p><p>Go to the options bar present at the top. Tap on “Select and Mask” to convert your selection into a mask. From the “Properties” panel, tap “View Mode” to determine how you want to see your selection. “Overlay” works best in general.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-2.jpg"                      alt="select the view mode"                ></p><p>Step 3: Polish the Edges</p><p>You can now further refine your selected part using the different tools offered by Photoshop. Use the “Quick Selection” tool to add or remove large areas. For hair and soft edges, you can use the “Refine Edge Brush” tool. The “Lasso&#x2F;Polygonal Lasso” tool can help manually draw areas for your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-3.jpg"                      alt="edit the image edges"                ></p><p>Step 4: Remove Residual Colors</p><p>From the panel at the right, select “Output Settings.” Check the box next to “Decontaminate Colors” to get rid of any leftover color fringe from your foreground. From “Output,” you now need to add a new layer by clicking on “New Layer with Layer Mask.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-4.jpg"                      alt="remove the selected color"                ></p><p>Step 5: Add a New Background</p><p>You can now paste the image you wish to add as a background for your photo. Position your image on the layer below the one with your foreground. You can resize your background image if required by selecting the “Free Transform” tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-5.jpg"                      alt="add new picture background"                ></p><p>Step 6: Fix the Colors</p><p>To blend the colors of your two images, select your foreground layer. Now go to “Image” and open “Adjustments.” From here, launch the “Match Color” popup window. Navigate to “Source” and select your image. From the “Layer” option, choose the layer you want to fix.</p><p>Tick the “Neutralize” box and adjust the “Luminance” and “Intensity” until you meet your requirements. You are all done now! Click “OK” and save your newly edited image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-6.jpg"                      alt="fix the image colors"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Blur-Photo-Background-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Blur-Photo-Background-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Blur Photo Background?"></a>Part 2: How to Blur Photo Background?</h2><p>A blurred background helps bring your image into focus. If you want a photo editor to blur background of your image, you can try Photoshop. Here are the steps for that:</p><p>Step 1: Isolate Subject</p><p>Isolate your subject on a separate layer by accessing the “Quick Selection” tool and clicking on the “Select Subject” button. You can use the “Lasso” tool to refine your selection. Click on “Select and Mask” and select the “Black and White View.” Now, choose the output to “New Layer with Layer Mask.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-7.jpg"                      alt="change the output"                ></p><p>Step 2: Expand the Selection</p><p>Hold the “CTRL” key and select your layer mask. Go to the “Select” tab, find and expand “Modify,” and tap “Expand.” Select a suitable number and tap “OK” Next, go to the “Edit” tab and select “Content-Aware Fill.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-8.jpg"                      alt="expand selection by pixels"                ></p><p>Step 3: Apply Photo Blur</p><p>Right-click on the background layer and choose “Convert to Smart Object.” Head over to the “Filter” tab, expand “Blur Gallery,” and choose “Tilt-Shift.” You can change the field lines to adjust the depth of field for your image and create a smooth transition. You can also control the intensity of the blur from the slider present on the right.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discovering-the-Magic-of-Augmented-Realms"><a href="#Discovering-the-Magic-of-Augmented-Realms" class="headerlink" title="Discovering the Magic of Augmented Realms"></a>Discovering the Magic of Augmented Realms</h2><h1 id="What-is-Augmented-Reality"><a href="#What-is-Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="What is Augmented Reality?"></a>What is Augmented Reality?</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Benjamin-Arango"><a href="#Benjamin-Arango" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Arango"></a>Benjamin Arango</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><h2 id="Definition-of-AR"><a href="#Definition-of-AR" class="headerlink" title="Definition of AR"></a>Definition of AR</h2><p> Augmented Reality (AR) is the application of technology to superimpose information on digitally rendered images into real world environments to give a sense of virtual reality or create an illusion. For example, images and sounds are superimposed over what users see and hear.</p><p> Unlike <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Virtual Reality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> where computer generated environments are used to interact with human beings and human beings get immersed into them, AR takes the real world of the present and projects digital imagery and sound into it.</p><p> The presentation of augmented reality is in some form of futuristic technology, despite the fact that it has been around for many years. For example, the heads-up display in many fighter jets utilizes the principles of augmented reality, and these date back to the early 1990s when they were used to show information about altitude, speed and direction of the aircraft.</p><h2 id="How-does-Augmented-Reality-work"><a href="#How-does-Augmented-Reality-work" class="headerlink" title="How does Augmented Reality work"></a>How does Augmented Reality work</h2><p> The kind of augmented reality you are likely to experience these days utilizes a range of sensors such as cameras and computer components as well as display devices in creating the illusion of virtual objects in the real world. Some of the smartphones in the market today have all the necessary components needed in the creation of augmented reality hence they are commonly used for most of AR experiences. The basic working of augmented reality is as follows-:</p><p> In general, the device will search for a particular object, which can be anything, but in most cases, they are usually 2D images like in the form of a movie poster. The augmented reality application will recognize the target through the camera and it will then process the image and augment it in some form through the utilization of sound and pictures. For example, if the target object was a movie poster, you may see it spring into life to play a trailer of the movie. So long as you continue viewing the poster through the “window” of the display object, you will see augmented reality rather than the plain old normal poster in normal reality.</p><h2 id="The-future-of-Augmented-Reality"><a href="#The-future-of-Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="The future of Augmented Reality"></a>The future of Augmented Reality</h2><p> The future of augmented reality has never been brighter as it is at the moment. Though mobile devices are the primary avenues for VR at the moment, this is not expected to remain the case since a lot of developments, enhancements and innovations are currently taking place in the industry. For instance, work is currently on in the development of augmented reality ear buds which will allow users to adjust sounds coming from the environment.</p><p> There is also ongoing research on AR for contact lenses and other wearable devices. The chief aim of augmented reality is to avail natural and convenient immersions and this practically means that the current mobile devices used for AR will be replaced, though it is still not known what exactly will replace them.</p><p> Like with every new technology, augmented reality comes with a plethora or ethical and political issues. For example, the Google Glass came along with a lot of privacy concerns, with some people worried that pictures may be snapped or conversations may be recorded surreptitiously. But amidst all these concerns, AR technology is expected to gather more steam in the near future and it will be a part of life for the majority.</p><h2 id="Applications-of-Augmented-Reality"><a href="#Applications-of-Augmented-Reality" class="headerlink" title="Applications of Augmented Reality"></a>Applications of Augmented Reality</h2><p> Augmented reality is used widely across different industries for various applications, with education and gaming taking the lion’s share of the uses. Discussed below are some of the applications of augmented reality:</p><ul><li><strong>Video Games</strong></li></ul><p> Playstation and Xbox are the main video game consoles where augmented reality capabilities have been included in their latest releases in the form of Kinetic and Playstation Eye for Xbox and Playstation respectively. Since gamers face both camera and the screen during the game play, players can see themselves in the game, where they have the ability to interact with the game characters just as if they were in the same room.</p><p> In addition to Playstation and Xbox implementation of augmented reality in their consoles, there are also mobile augmented reality games and these are available on tablets, smartphones and handheld consoles like Playstation Vita and the Nintendo 3DS.</p><ul><li><strong>Education</strong></li></ul><p> The potential of augmented reality in education is immense. Currently, the technology is widely applied in fields such as medicine in the simulation of 3D models used for teaching students. It is also possible to use existing learning materials like pages of a textbook in augmented reality. For instance, by targeting the picture of an engine in an engineering textbook, augmented reality can be used to animate the picture of the engine or even a working 3D model of the heart for better comprehension by the learners.</p><ul><li><strong>Medicine</strong></li></ul><p> In medicine, augmented reality is used to project information on the patient’s body. For instance, the Veinviewer system is currently being used to project images of vein scans directly on the human skin to make it easier for the medics to locate where the various veins are. With this kind of application, the skin appears to be “transparent” and the clinicians can easily see the veins directly.</p><ul><li><strong>Shopping</strong></li></ul><p> Augmented reality is expected to change the shape of commerce, equipping shoppers with the ability to browse the entire catalogs of favorite brands or stores in a more interactive manner. Through the technology, parks and airports could be turned into shopping destinations which will not just be an awesome way to kill time, but also an inventive way for businesses to save a lot of money in commercial real estate.</p><ul><li><strong>Augmented Reality in Travel</strong></li></ul><p> For travel, augmented reality can be used to provide budget “travel” options or quick “getaway” to places and sites you have always longed to visit. For instance, you can easily pop up the Leaning Tower of Pisa or the Eiffel Tower right in your backyard and explore all the monuments in a virtual vacation.</p><p> The same could be used at home in the classrooms for teaching history, where students can take “class trips” to historical sites such as the Great Wall of China, thus making learning more personal, enjoyable and memorable.</p><ul><li><strong>Safety and Rescue Operations</strong></li></ul><p> In times of emergencies, first responders such as the police and firefighters usually arrive at chaotic scenes and these sometimes hamper their rescue operations. With augmented reality, the responders could have x-ray visions or virtual maps to give them a better idea of what to expect on the ground so that the SAR operations can be more effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-perfecting-presentation-adding-textures-to-your-project/"><u>2024 Approved  Perfecting Presentation  Adding Textures to Your Project</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-basic-techniques-for-effective-color-grading-in-ps/"><u>2024 Approved  Basic Techniques for Effective Color Grading in PS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-combined-sound-and-sight-workstation/"><u>[New] In 2024, Combined Sound & Sight Workstation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/2024-approved-drone-guide-for-the-thrifty-consumer-cost-effective-choices/"><u>2024 Approved  Drone Guide for the Thrifty Consumer  Cost-Effective Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-ultimate-5-online-av-creation-leaders/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Ultimate 5 Online AV Creation Leaders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-optimal-scripting-solutions-in-ae/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Optimal Scripting Solutions in AE</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-essential-apps-for-annotating-mobile-images/"><u>[New] In 2024, Essential Apps for Annotating Mobile Images</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-lut-enthusiasts-delight-free-bundles-with-dji-minis-and-air-2/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  LUT Enthusiasts' Delight – Free Bundles with DJI Minis & Air 2</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-discovering-the-edge-of-action-cam-excellence-with-intova-x-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Discovering the Edge of Action Cam Excellence with Intova X for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-creative-freedom-redefined-a-review-of-screenflow-on-macbook-pro/"><u>[New] Creative Freedom Redefined  A Review of ScreenFlow on MacBook Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-amalgamate-ppts-for-video-creation/"><u>2024 Approved  Amalgamate PPTs for Video Creation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-skys-best-expertly-curated-list-of-drones-and-their-editing-pals/"><u>[New] Sky's Best  Expertly Curated List of Drones & Their Editing Pals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-breaking-barriers-in-photography-mastering-gopro-time-lapse/"><u>[Updated] Breaking Barriers in Photography  Mastering GoPro Time-Lapse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/2024-approved-enhancing-media-workflow-the-rise-of-magix-vpx/"><u>2024 Approved  Enhancing Media Workflow  The Rise of Magix VPX</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-rotational-realities-how-to-captivate-with-instagrams-sideways-videos-for-2024/"><u>[New] Rotational Realities  How to Captivate with Instagram's Sideways Videos for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/tips-and-tricks-for-setting-up-your-vivo-phone-pattern-lock-by-drfone-android/"><u>Tips and Tricks for Setting Up your Vivo Phone Pattern Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-pivotal-moments-top-20-anime-themes/"><u>2024 Approved  Pivotal Moments  Top 20 Anime Themes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://meme-emoji.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-make-memoji-talk-make-memoji-video-on-your-own/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved How to Make Memoji Talk-Make Memoji Video On Your Own</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-comprehensive-guide-to-creating-movies-not-just-youtube/"><u>In 2024, The Comprehensive Guide to Creating Movies, Not Just YouTube</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Bridging-Distances-with-Easy-to-Use-Xbox-Zooming"><a href="#Bridging-Distances-with-Easy-to-Use-Xbox-Zooming" class="headerlink" title="Bridging Distances with Easy-to-Use Xbox Zooming"></a>Bridging Distances with Easy-to-Use Xbox Zooming</h2><p>Zoom has been in the trend since the world witnessed Covid-19. Now gamers even want to experience video conferencing while playing their games. Unfortunately, there is no availability of <strong>zoom on Xbox one.</strong> Zoom is available on almost every platform and device, but for Xbox, it has some more time. It appears that Zoom won’t return to Xbox anytime soon, and competitiveness would be one of the primary causes.</p><p>Why would Microsoft let a third-party video chatting app since they already have successful ones of their own? What then seems to be in the Zoom? Players still want that on their Xbox despite the fact that it is unlikely to materialize anytime soon. Before going any further, how can I access Zoom meetings on Xbox One? Have a brief overview of Zoom’s capabilities to comprehend the pressing XBOX requirement better.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Is-Zoom-app-available-on-Xbox"><a href="#Part-1-Is-Zoom-app-available-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Is Zoom app available on Xbox"></a>Part 1. Is Zoom app available on Xbox</h2><p>Zoom is one of the famous and user-friendly audio and video chat programs. It is a cloud-based app that allows the user to meet anyone online. Zoom is one of the best platforms to work from home. The world is using zoom for video conferencing at work from home. It is the best personal platform for video chats with friends and family. This app has the best features when it comes to virtual meetings or calls, and that’s why it has several users.</p><p>The Xbox network has a crucial part of the Xbox system. Users can use the web to purchase several games and watch videos and share their recorded videos. It allows their user to use skype for communication and keep track of their friends, game progress, and achievements. Users can even play their multiplayer games on Xbox with other players online.</p><p>Zoom has launched an application known as Zoom Room. This room is also a casting app that allows cast meetings from Mac, PC, or Xbox. So recently, the application was removed from the Xbox app. The only way of using <strong>Zoom meeting on Xbox one</strong> is through Screen Cast.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Get-Zoom-Meeting-on-Xbox-One-using-Chromecast"><a href="#Part-2-Get-Zoom-Meeting-on-Xbox-One-using-Chromecast" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Get Zoom Meeting on Xbox One using Chromecast"></a>Part 2. Get Zoom Meeting on Xbox One using Chromecast</h2><p>It is already mentioned that Zoom doesn’t support Xbox. You may be late because the XBOX has Zoom Rooms in their app store, which might help the users to get zoom meetings on the Xbox. But, recently, it got removed by Xbox from the App Store, which left Xbox gamers disconnected.</p><p>But there is nothing to worry about, and you might have heard the phrase “if there is a will, there is a way.” You can also get a zoom meeting i.e. on Xbox with another option. That way is known as Screen Casting. It is a straightforward method of <strong>using zoom on Xbox one</strong>, but most ignored by many of its users. Let’s look at how you can use a screencast by using Chromecast on the Xbox.</p><ul><li>For setting up a Zoom meeting i.e. on Xbox, at first, you will have to “plug in” Chromecast that is to Xbox One’s HDMI port.</li><li>Now, opt for moving to the Xbox Pins and then find the TV app; select to launch that application.</li><li>After choosing the TV app, you will be told to connect the satellite box or cable. You can tap on the “A” button on the remote to select the option.</li><li>After a few times, the Chromecast can get detected by Xbox One, which will appear in a small window. After that, at this point, the next button will get activated and once the button gets activated, click “Next.”</li><li>If you wish to set up the Xbox One for controlling the Casting Screen, tap on “Next.” If it is not, you can click on “Skip” and move to the next screen.</li><li>In the next window, choose what you wish to do after Xbox starts. You can select “On Start, Open TV or go home after it starts. After you select the option from the drop-down, you can now opt for clicking “Next” to complete the Chromecast setup.</li><li>After successful setup, switch back to the casting device, i.e., iPhone, Android, iPad, Mac, Laptop or Desktop, etc.</li><li>Now, opt to visit settings and then opt for clicking on the Cast.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-meeting-cast.jpg"                      alt="zoom meeting cast"                ></p><ul><li>At this point, the list of every installed device gets displayed on the device screen.</li><li>Now, opt for choosing Xbox One by choosing the gaming console name for casting the device’s screen on Xbox One.</li><li>You can now launch Zoom meetings or rooms on the device, which can then be cast directly to the Xbox One.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-Setup-Zoom-Conference-on-Xbox"><a href="#Part-3-Setup-Zoom-Conference-on-Xbox" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Setup Zoom Conference on Xbox"></a>Part 3. Setup Zoom Conference on Xbox</h2><p>It is one of the most used apps amongst applications available.

Here people live stream all aspects of their lives. However, if you would like to be a part of a new gaming community and have access to the MacOS feature, then Mixer stream can work for you.</p><p>Section1. <a href="#mixer-vs-twitch">Mixer VS Twitch</a></p><p>Section2. <a href="#steps-of-stream-on-mixer-via-macbook">Steps of Stream on Mixer via MacBook</a></p><p>Between Mixer stream and Twitch stream, one will absolutely be better for your personal style. So which is better? Let’s compare Mixer and Twitch to help you decide which is best for you.</p><h2 id="Section-1-Mixer-VS-Twitch"><a href="#Section-1-Mixer-VS-Twitch" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. Mixer VS Twitch"></a>Section 1. Mixer VS Twitch</h2><ul><li>What is Mixer?</li></ul><p>Mixer steam was initially known as Beam when it was introduced in 2016. A few months later, Microsoft gained the streaming service and renamed it to the Mixer. And only a few months later the company announced that the service will become a built-in feature on Windows 10. Mixer stream is a live streaming platform, similar to Twitch, that is most commonly used for live broadcasts of gaming videos, although you can create your own podcasts or streams centered on any other topic you like.</p><p>Streaming on Mixer can require a little effort, and you must make sure you have all the right software like OBS before you begin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/mixer.jpg"                                     ></p><ul><li>What is Twitch?</li></ul><p>Twitch is a leading live streaming platform founded in 2011 with the main purpose being video games. It initially started as a spinoff division of Justin.tv, with gaming being the main priority. The platform allows users to interact with others, play games and stream their own games. Almost anything you would like to watch is available. In any Twitch channel, a streamer normally inlays a webcam video and interacts with their viewers with an IRC-style chat-room and a microphone.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/twitch.jpg"                                     ></p><p>Both of them are the most common gaming streaming platforms, but there are still some differences.</p><p><strong>Because of FTL technology, Mixer live streaming is a bit faster than Twitch.</strong> On stream, there is less than a second of delay. While on Twitch, the delay can go up to 20 seconds, hence making it difficult to interact with a viewer. However, <strong>Twitch VODs are easier to record and navigate.</strong> Also, the Twitch dashboard is very powerful, with good analytics.</p><p>On Twitch, streamers can earn money through micro-donation, subscriptions, and advertisements. It allows viewers to subscribe for free to streamers once a month. On the other hand, Mixer stream offers “embers”. Users can donate these embers to any streamer. Therefore, streamers can make money right away which is not the case with Twitch that requires you to meet affiliate requirements before you make any money.</p><p>Twitch has the largest number of streamers. It is hard to get noticed on Twitch because it can showcase many streamers at once. Also, Twitch stream is older, which makes it have many viewers. Many users already know their favorite streamers and are probably not looking for more. For a new streamer, it can take time before you become a Twitch partner, which is not the case with the Mixer stream because of less competition.</p><h2 id="Section-2-Steps-of-Stream-on-Mixer-via-MacBook"><a href="#Section-2-Steps-of-Stream-on-Mixer-via-MacBook" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.

Before we go to the solution, let’s list the devices that are compatible with Airdrop.</p><h2 id="Airdrop-not-working-Is-your-device-compatible-with-Airdrop"><a href="#Airdrop-not-working-Is-your-device-compatible-with-Airdrop" class="headerlink" title="Airdrop not working?

To avoid this complexity, we recommend you choose “Everyone”.</p><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> Open Settings of your iPhone or iPad device.</p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> From all these options, Tap on General</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios.png"                      alt="airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios"                ></p><p><strong>Step 03:</strong> Now select Airdrop</p><p><strong>Step 04:</strong> From these three options, make sure to choose “Everyone”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios2.jpg"                      alt="airdrop-detail-setting-on-ios2"                ></p><p>It will make your device visible to everyone around you whether they are on your contact list or not.</p><h2 id="Airdrop-Setting-on-Mac"><a href="#Airdrop-Setting-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Airdrop Setting on Mac"></a>Airdrop Setting on Mac</h2><p>If you are trying to use Airdrop from iPhone or iPad to Mac but the mac is not being shown in the list, try the following steps.</p><p><strong>Step 01:</strong> Click on the Finder</p><p><strong>Step 02:</strong> It will open a new window.

You could wish to employ the common music production method of fading songs in and out of your podcast using Audacity fade. To make an engaging and deeper podcast, it’s helpful to understand how to slightly fade out the music so that it plays in the background but still makes it easy to hear the spoken track. There are a few ways to do this.</p><p>You can easily apply professional fades to your audio files with Audacity fade out effect. The audio in the chosen portion will progressively get quieter when the fade out effect is applied, ending in stillness. The fade out tool is nearly totally automated, making it simple and understandable for both novices and experts. Along with the other several tools under Audacity’s Effects menu, the fade out tool may be found there.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Linear-Fade-in-out"><a href="#Part-1-Linear-Fade-in-out" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Linear Fade in&#x2F;out"></a>Part 1. Linear Fade in&#x2F;out</h2><p>You may apply linear fades, a straightforward fade option, to any segment of your music. Alternatively, you might apply it to the full audio file. Linear fades come in two varieties. Fade-in and Fade-out are the two varieties. Any section of your audio that you apply a fade-in to will get muted and return to its original volume. Additionally, if you activate the fade-out feature in your audio, the audio will transition from its original volume to total quiet.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Linear-Fade-in-out"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Linear-Fade-in-out" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Linear Fade in&#x2F;out:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Linear Fade in&#x2F;out:</strong></h3><p>To divide a track into several parts so you may apply a fade to a specific audio segment, press Cmd + I (or Ctrl + I).</p><p>In this example, we divided the clip at the eight-second mark and used the Time Shift tool to shift the second chunk to the new location.</p><p>By selecting the audio segment, you wish to fade out and selecting Effect &gt; Fade Out, you may add a fade-out to the initial clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/liner-fade-in-audacity.jpg"                      alt="liner fade in audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Studio-Fade-Out"><a href="#Part-2-Studio-Fade-Out" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Studio Fade Out"></a>Part 2. Studio Fade Out</h2><p>This effect is shown by Audacity as a curve that resembles the letter S. It results in a very gentle fading. After the first boom, there is utter quiet. It’s a sound that actually gives off the impression of fading away over time. Using the repeat last effect, you can quickly repeat this fading option. Additionally, Ctrl + R serves as the shortcut for the same.</p><h3 id="How-to-Use-Studio-Fade-Out"><a href="#How-to-Use-Studio-Fade-Out" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Studio Fade Out:"></a><strong>How to Use Studio Fade Out:</strong></h3><p>Choose your audio segment, go to the Effect menu, slide to the bottom, and pick Studio Fade Out to apply the effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/studio-fade-out-audacity.jpg"                      alt="studio fade out audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Adjustable-Fade"><a href="#Part-3-Adjustable-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Adjustable Fade"></a>Part 3. Adjustable Fade</h2><p>A dialog box will show up on the screen when you choose the customizable fade option. You may customize the form and pattern of the fading using that dialog box. You may use this ability to make partial fades if you’d like. You must maintain the tracks stacked one on top of the other with the lower track underneath the higher track and its end overlapping when employing this form of fade.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Adjustable-Fade"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Adjustable-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Adjustable Fade:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Adjustable Fade:</strong></h3><ul><li>Select Effect from the menu.</li><li>Select the variable fading option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/adjustable-fade-audio-audacity.jpg"                      alt="adjustable fade audio audacity"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Crossfades-Audacity"><a href="#Part-4-Crossfades-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. Crossfades Audacity"></a>Part 4. Crossfades Audacity</h2><p>There are two choices available when using this effect. You have two options: either manually make a crossfade of your own, or utilize one of the pre-existing crossfades in Audacity. In Audacity, there are two crossfades that are accessible. Crossfade clips and Crossfade tracks are what they are. Crossfade clips make it easier to switch between two distinct clips. Additionally, crossfade tracks aid in crossfading between two audio tracks and are more exact.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Crossfades"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Crossfades" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Crossfades:"></a><strong>Steps to Use Crossfades:</strong></h3><p>Using the Time Shift Tool, place your two clips adjacent to one another in order to apply a crossfade across them on the same track.</p><p>Select the area to be crossfaded using the Selection tool, and then click Effect &gt; Crossfade Clips to combine the sounds you’ve chosen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/crossafade-audio-with-audacity.jpg"                      alt="crossafade audio with audacity"                ></p><p>Use your Selection tool to organize the clips such that a crossfade will be applied between two clips on different tracks. Go to Effect &gt; Crossfade Songs, place the cursor where you want the fade to begin, then drag it across the tracks you wish to blend.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio"><a href="#Part-5-Alternative-Way-to-Fade-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 5. Alternative Way to Fade Audio"></a>Part 5.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Crafting-Dissolves-with-Ableton-Live"><a href="#Crafting-Dissolves-with-Ableton-Live" class="headerlink" title="Crafting Dissolves with Ableton Live"></a>Crafting Dissolves with Ableton Live</h2><p>As a result of its distinctive method of loop-based composition, Ableton live fades are favorite among hip-hop and electronic music producers. Ableton Live is one of the greatest DAWs to learn if you’re just beginning to make beats or write songs. For many artists, Ableton Live has emerged as the preferred setting for writing music with an eye on live performance. If you’re coming from a conventionally built digital audio workstation, Live’s approach to composition and arrangement is undoubtedly odd.</p><p>One of the most user-friendly pieces of music software ever created is Ableton Live. With a little instruction, you can quickly master Ableton fade and produce recordings of studio-caliber. Since then, Ableton has emerged as one of the top names in electronic music production. Live is a robust DAW with mature capabilities that can be used to produce any kind of music, although it works especially well with certain processes. Follow this guide to learn about Ableton fade in detail.</p><h2 id="Part-1-2-Ways-to-Fade-audio-in-Ableton"><a href="#Part-1-2-Ways-to-Fade-audio-in-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton"></a>Part 1. 2 Ways to Fade audio in Ableton</h2><p>You’ve certainly heard the terms “audio fade-in” and “audio fade-out” a few times as a newbie, and you may be wondering what they mean and how you might apply them to your films. Crossfading clips on the same track is easier and only needs one track, however crossfading clips on different tracks allows you to apply independent audio effects processing and gives greater flexibility in structuring the fade curves. Both strategies may be helpful for organizing and creating sounds.</p><h3 id="Way-1-Use-Warp-Fades"><a href="#Way-1-Use-Warp-Fades" class="headerlink" title="Way 1. Use Warp&#x2F;Fades"></a>Way 1. Use Warp&#x2F;Fades</h3><p>To avoid any clicks, turn on Create Fades on Clip Edges in the Record&#x2F;Warp&#x2F;Launch section of Live’s Preferences. The beginning and ending of the Clip will each have a little fade.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-fades-warp-fades.jpg"                      alt="create fades warp fades"                ></p><p>You must disable the automated mode in order to alter the clip fades. You may accomplish this by doing the following:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/disable-automated-mode-ableton.jpg"                      alt="disable automated mode ableton"                ></p><p>The fade-in and fade-out handles should display when you hover the mouse icon over the audio clip you want to fade. In case, if they don’t, hit ‘A’ on your keyboard to make them appear. Then, you hold down the mouse button while left-clicking on the handle you wish to fade and lowering the fader.</p><h3 id="Way-2-Using-the-MIDI-Track"><a href="#Way-2-Using-the-MIDI-Track" class="headerlink" title="Way 2. Using the MIDI Track"></a>Way 2. Using the MIDI Track</h3><p>In the method 2, you can use it on MIDI track. It will load the Utility effect to the specified MIDI track wherever you drag it on the track. Left-click on the little box in the bottom right corner of the DAW to view the Utility effect on your track. Follow the procedure below to do so.<br>Live’s ability to easily clean up the beginning and conclusion of audio samples has long been one of its strengths. Simply hit A and hover over the clip to check sure Automation Mode isn’t turned on. There are two handles you may drag on the left and right, as well as two curve adjusters:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/midi-track-ableton.jpg"                      alt="midi track ableton"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Alternative-way-to-Fade-Audio-without-Ableton"><a href="#Part-2-Alternative-way-to-Fade-Audio-without-Ableton" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Here we will tell you everything from how to shoot to editing time-lapse videos. You will also get some tips for time-lapse recording video so let’s start with this article.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Time-lapse-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?"></a>Part 1. What is Time-lapse Video?</h2><p>Time-lapse video is considered a technique of cinematography where a photographer takes a series of images in the same frame at several intervals for a certain period and rapidly plays it for the entire time. For instance:- Separate shots of a flower blooming over time becomes a video of growing a flower from seedling to bloom.</p><p>So what’s the purpose of it? Here is the purpose of creating an illusion of extreme speed movement by manipulating the time. It seems like the object is rushing at a fast pace. This cinematography technique is mainly used for capturing prolonged processes that will become exciting and visible if it is watched with the human eye.</p><p>The time-lapse is even used to capture swift movement, showing it faster. This article will explore how time-lapse on canon 6d is made. In simple words, time-lapse is a process of shooting for an extended period and then editing in fast motion to make it enjoyable. Let’s see how it is done.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Shoot-Time-lapse-Video-with-Canon-Camera" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?"></a>Part 2. How to Shoot Time-lapse Video with Canon Camera?</h2><p>Let’s explore the time-lapse world in the comfort of your home or when you are chilling out with your family and friends. You can use your Canon 70d time-lapse to do it better. The time-lapse is an innovative technique that allows you to reveal a hidden world on the move, and it will produce some magical and surprising results. Let’s check out the steps of hooting time-lapse video with a Canon camera.</p><p><strong>1:-</strong> Change your Canon camera settings to the Time-lapse movie by tapping on the menu and searching Timelapse Movie mode in your menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-time-lapse-canon-camera.jpg"                      alt="enable time lapse on canon"                ></p><p><strong>2:-</strong> Tap on the info button to access the setting for the interval time and the no. of shots.</p><p><strong>3:-</strong> You can choose the interval number to determine your camera’s frequency, which means once every second or twice a minute. The interval time will depend on the subject. Recording a slow-moving object like blossoming flowers or drifting clouds will take more time between the shots and vice versa.</p><p><strong>4:-</strong> Put the number of shots you want your camera to take. According to the interval and number of shots, your Canon 80d time-lapse will tell you the number of footage you have to take to end the video. There is a general thumb rule for recording time-lapse videos, and you will need around 24-25 images for each second of your video.</p><p><strong>5:-</strong> Compose the shot and tap on the shutter button. While shooting the time-lapse video, it is recommended that you should place the camera on a tripod to maintain the composition of duration. Also, after you are happy with the composition and settings, you can tap the shutter button and allow your camera to show its magic.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips"><a href="#Part-3-Canon-Time-Lapse-Video-Shooting-Tips" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Also, you can take some random test shots. This ensures you get the best composition and angle you are looking for.</p><p><strong>Always take photos in JPG:-</strong> Set the Canon Camera to capture pictures in the best JPG quality, or else you can run out of space quickly.</p><p><strong>Use manual mode:-</strong> It’s recommended to shoot in manual mode, and you must shoot with the manual white balance, exposure, aperture, and shutter speed. Moreover, it will help you to avoid auto-adjusting your camera.</p><p><strong>Carry extra batteries:-</strong> If you want to create a time-lapse video outdoors, you must carry extra batteries. Also, it is good if the camera battery is changed before your camera gets shut down. If you are shooting time-lapse video indoors, it’s better to use the main charger. Also, it will help you avoid excess battery draining.</p><p><strong>Carry Extra Memory cards:-</strong> You will never want to run out of space while making a time-lapse, and you will have to make the calculations according to your time-lapse. Also, make sure you carry the extra memory cards to be prepared.</p><p><strong>Choose the best spot:-</strong> Set your tripod securely and in a place where it cannot be knocked or moved quickly.</p><p><strong>Focus on the camera:-</strong> Always ensure that the equipment and camera are in sight while you are shooting and safe.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer"><a href="#Part-4-Extra-How-to-Edit-Timelapse-Video-on-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

That’s a great idea! Giveaways are a great way to engage with your fans and followers, and they can also help to promote your business. But before you start posting about your giveaway, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. Here are some tips for running a successful Facebook giveaway.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Choose-a-giveaway-prize-that-is-relevant-to-your-target-audience"><a href="#Part-1-Choose-a-giveaway-prize-that-is-relevant-to-your-target-audience" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Choose a giveaway prize that is relevant to your target audience"></a>Part 1. Choose a giveaway prize that is relevant to your target audience</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/choose-giveaway-prize-for-facebook.jpg"                      alt="choose giveaway prize for facebook"                ></p><p>When it comes to choosing a giveaway prize, relevant is always the best way to go. First, consider your target audience. What would they be interested in? A coffee mug with your company logo may be great for some, but if you’re targeting outdoorsy types, they might prefer a hiking hat or water bottle.</p><p>Really think about what your target audience would find useful or fun, and choose a prize accordingly. It’ll make them more likely to enter the giveaway, and more likely to remember your brand down the line. Plus, it’ll show that you’re tuned into their interests - always a plus in the eyes of potential customers. So, when you’re planning your next giveaway, keep relevance front and center, and you’ll be sure to choose a winner.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Make-sure-the-giveaway-is-compliant-with-Facebook’s-rules"><a href="#Part-2-Make-sure-the-giveaway-is-compliant-with-Facebook’s-rules" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Otherwise, your giveaway could be shut down and you could be at risk of being banned from the platform. Here are a few things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>You must use a third-party app to host your giveaway. Facebook does not allow giveaways to be hosted directly on its platform.</li><li>Your giveaway must have clearly defined rules. For example, you will need to specify how winners will be chosen and what the prize is.</li><li>You are responsible for ensuring that your giveaway is fair and legal. This means making sure that there is no purchase necessary to enter and that the prize is not illegal or restricted in any way.</li><li>Make sure you promote your giveaway in a way that complies with Facebook’s advertising policies. For example, you cannot include false or misleading information in your posts about the giveaway.</li></ul><p>Following these guidelines will help to ensure that your Facebook giveaway is successful and compliant with the platform’s rules.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Promote-your-giveaway-on-other-channels-such-as-your-website-and-email-list"><a href="#Part-3-Promote-your-giveaway-on-other-channels-such-as-your-website-and-email-list" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

But how do you make sure that people actually see your giveaway? One of the best ways is to promote it on other channels, such as your website or email list. This ensures that your target audience is aware of the giveaway and has a chance to enter.</p><p>Additionally, you can use social media to spread the word about your giveaway. By sharing it with your followers and tagging relevant hashtags, you can reach a wider audience and increase the chances of someone taking notice. With a little effort, you can make sure that your next giveaway is a success.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Set-a-deadline-for-entering-the-giveaway"><a href="#Part-4-Set-a-deadline-for-entering-the-giveaway" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

This will help to create a sense of urgency and encourage people to action. It’s also important to be clear about what the deadline is.</p><p>For example, if you’re giving away a prize every day, make sure to specify that entrants must submit their entry by 11:59 PM on the day of the drawing. Finally, don’t forget to promote the deadline! Make sure that your social media posts and emails include information about when the giveaway ends.</p><p>By taking these simple steps, you can make sure that your giveaway runs smoothly and meets your goals.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Choose-a-winner-randomly-from-among-all-entrants"><a href="#Part-5-Choose-a-winner-randomly-from-among-all-entrants" class="headerlink" title="Part 5.

Be sure to include all of the necessary information, such as the recipient’s name and address.</p><p>Step4 Once the label is printed out, simply attach it to the package and drop it off at your local post office.

This is due to the launch of platforms like Twitch and Youtube, which have made it easier for content creators&#x2F;streamers to reach a wide audience. But how do these two platforms differ?</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a comprehensive look at <strong>Twitch vs. Youtube</strong> by comparing their browsing, content rule leniency, growth, and monetization. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of which platform is right for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-vs-youtube.jpg"                      alt="twitch vs youtube"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube"></a>Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube</h2><p>Though Twitch and YouTube share some similarities, there are also some key differences between the two:</p><p><strong>Browsing:</strong> Twitch and YouTube are search engines, but they differ in how they recommend videos to viewers. Twitch focuses on more popular streamers and doesn’t let users edit their thumbnails, while YouTube makes it easier for newbies to be found with a customizable thumbnail feature.</p><p><strong>Content Rule Leniency:</strong> Twitch and YouTube’s content guidelines are slightly different. YouTube is more easygoing when it comes to what videos can be posted. On the other hand, Twitch has a reputation for banning streamers without any justification. Even streamers with contracts seem to be treated the same as anyone else when this happens.</p><p><strong>Growth:</strong> YouTube offers more advantages over Twitch in terms of growth as it is more accessible and has a better algorithm that allows small content creators to grow their channels quickly. However, Twitch mainly focuses on popular content streamers and offers fewer growth opportunities for newbies.</p><p><strong>Monetization:</strong> When it comes to monetization, both platforms offer different options for content creators. On Twitch, content creators can earn revenue from subscriptions, sponsored advertisements, donations, affiliate programs, merchandise sales, etc. On YouTube, content creators can earn revenue from direct advertisements, sponsorships, partnership programs, streams, donations, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-monetization.jpg"                      alt="youtube monetization"                ></p><p><strong>Chat and Moderation Policies:</strong> Twitch uses a time-based strict chat moderation policy and does not have the pause or rewind option. While on YouTube, the chat is arranged based on relevance and comes with only standard emojis for visual presentation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Comparison of Two Important Features Between Twitch and YOUTUBE: Partnership and Gaming</h2><h3 id="YouTube-vs-Twitch-Partnership"><a href="#YouTube-vs-Twitch-Partnership" class="headerlink" title="YouTube vs. Twitch Partnership"></a>YouTube vs. Twitch Partnership</h3><p>Affiliate programs are accessible on both Twitch and YouTube with specific requirements that you need to adhere to. These include a consistent uploading or streaming schedule, viewer engagement on your content, certain watch times, and the required number of subscribers on your channel.</p><p>Unlike YouTube, Twitch offers both affiliate and partnership programs.

Over the past few years, two of the biggest platforms for streaming gaming content have been Twitch and YouTube. So which platform is worth using? Let’s find out!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-gaming.jpg"                      alt="twitch gaming"                ></p><p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Twitch algorithm is mainly based on the number of viewers on your videos. Moreover, when browsing, it mainly suggests only the popular streamers with a strong subscriber base.</p><p>On the other hand, YouTube is owned by Google and creates more opportunities for streamers to be found. Also, its search algorithm takes into account the number of likes, comments, and shares on your video.</p><p><strong>Streamer-Viewer Dynamics:</strong> On Twitch, viewers often get more involved with the streamer as opposed to YouTube gaming viewers, who prefer to watch videos without commentary.</p><p><strong>Engagement Requirements For Streamers:</strong> To grow on YouTube, you need at least 4000 hours of watch time and a good number of likes, shares, and comments on your video. While on Twitch, you need at least a 20-30% engagement rate and a large number of subscribers.</p><p><strong>Competition Level Of Streamer:</strong> YouTube has fewer streamers but a 20 times more extensive user base. The potential for growth for new streamers is much higher due to the lower competition on the platform. Additionally, the platform provides more prominent exposure for new content creators.</p><h3 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h3><p>Twitch is a better streaming platform if you want to cultivate a following around your content. Although creating your followers’ community at first can be difficult, it largely depends on how engaging and compelling your content is.</p><p>As a new content creator or a streamer to create and upload pre-recorded videos, YouTube is a better choice for you. Make sure to upload the most enthralling games to keep your audience captivating and interested.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More"><a href="#Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?"></a>Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?</h2><p>The amount of revenue you can make on Twitch or YouTube is directly related to your follower base. The higher the number of followers&#x2F;viewers, the more you will earn. Here’s how each platform pays its streamers.</p><h3 id="How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How Twitch Pay Their Streamers"></a>How Twitch Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>There are five ways in which you can make money while streaming your content on Twitch:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> You can turn on ads on your content when your stream gets the affiliate’s status. Ad revenues are based on the number of impressions (views) your content receives, and the average payout is $0.25 - $1.50 per 1,000 views.</p><p><strong>Bits</strong>: As a streamer on Twitch, you can also receive donations from your viewers in the form of a unique currency on the platform known as Bits. It’s important to note that Twitch takes a 29% cut-off of all donations made this way, leaving the streamer with 71% of the total donation. We have a complete guide to help you understand <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what Twitch Bits are and how to earn&#x2F;get them for free. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-bits.jpg"                      alt="twitch bits"                ></p><p><strong>Donations:</strong> Donations made through Paypal or other monetary exchange platforms benefit the streamer as they will receive 100% of the donation. This is the cheaper way of ensuring that the streamer gets the entire donation amount from the viewer.</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> Subscribers can support your channel by getting a subscription for a minimum of $4.99 per month. Twitch only takes 50% of subscription fees. This makes it much more profitable for streamers, as they can earn $2.50 per subscription per month.</p><p><strong>Merchandise:</strong> In terms of merchandise, Twitch has an advantage over YouTube because it comes with various merchandising extensions that can help you to make sales directly to your viewers during a live stream without the need for them to leave the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-monetization.jpg"                      alt="twitch monetization"                ></p><h3 id="How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How YouTube Pay Their Streamers"></a>How YouTube Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>YouTube pays its streamers in three different ways:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> Once your channel reaches a specific threshold, you become eligible for displaying ads on your YouTube channel. YouTube ads pay more than Twitch. For each 1000 ad views, you will get $18, which means you can earn up to $3 to $5 per 1k video views.</p><p><strong>Members:</strong> YouTube members are equivalent to Twitch’s subscribers. YouTube pays 70% of membership fees to the creators. The eligibility to offer channel memberships opens up at 30,000 subscribers for all types of channels, but for gaming channels, in particular, a minimum of 1,000 subscribers are required. Additionally, creators must also be a part of the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p><strong>Super Chat:</strong> Youtube pays streamers 70% of each super chat donation made on the platform and retains 30%. While this may seem to be expensive, it helps cover the costs of hosting a Livestream. Without this donation, Youtube would not be able to function as smoothly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-super-chat.jpg"                      alt="youtube super chat"                ></p><h3 id="Which-Pays-More"><a href="#Which-Pays-More" class="headerlink" title="Which Pays More?"></a>Which Pays More?</h3><p>Due to the lower threshold for monetization, Twitch pays more to the new content creators and offers more monetization options. However, it is difficult to grow on Twitch compared to YouTube, which has a stronger user base.</p><p>YouTube is easier to generate income in the long run as you can upload recorded gaming videos which can get more viewers as it is always available on the platform. Moreover, you can also make more from YouTube ads than on Twitch.</p><p><strong>Video - Where Should You Stream in 2022? - Twitch vs YouTube Live</strong></p><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?"></a>How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?</h3><p>On YouTube, a streamer mainly gets paid based on the ads, which is $0.10 to $0.30 per ad view.

This can be done using various devices, such as smart gloves, often known as data gloves.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss <strong>Hand Tracking</strong> technology, its various applications, and how to create it using Python, OpenCV, and Media Pipe.</p><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Tracking With Interface</a></li><li><a href="#part2-2">Tracking Without Interface</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part3">Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part3-1">What is OpenCV</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-2">What Is Media Pipe</a>  </li><li><a href="#part3-3">Guidance With Steps</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part4">Use Filmora to demonstarte your Hand Tracking skill</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Hand-Tracking-Where-Is-It-Applied" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?"></a>Part 1. What Is Hand Tracking? Where Is It Applied?</h2><p>Hand Tracking refers to the process of tracking the position and movement of a user’s hands in virtual reality. This is usually done using a combination of sensors, including cameras, infrared sensors, or ultrasonic sensors.</p><p>By tracking the user’s hands, VR systems can provide more immersive and interactive experiences. For example, Hand Tracking can be used to allow users to interact with virtual objects, as well as to provide input for gestures and body language.</p><p>The Oculus Quest 2 is a virtual reality headset that immerses you in virtual worlds. Quest 2’s one of the coolest features is Hand Tracking, which lets you interact with the virtual world around you using your hands.</p><p>With Hand Tracking, you can interact with the virtual world more naturally and intuitively. You can use your hands to pick up objects, draw, and even type on a virtual keyboard. Moreover, it opens up new possibilities for gameplay, allowing you to play games in new and innovative ways.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/hand-tracking-technology.jpg"                      alt="hand tracking technology"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-2-Types-Of-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking"></a>Part 2. Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking"></a>Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.</p><p>There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:</p><ol><li><strong>Palm Detection</strong>: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.</li><li><strong>Hand Landmarks Identification</strong>: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/20-hand-landmarks-for-identifiction-hand-tracking.jpg"                      alt="20 hand landmarks for identifiction – hand tracking"                ></p><h3 id="Guidance-With-Steps"><a href="#Guidance-With-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Guidance With Steps"></a>Guidance With Steps</h3><p>Before starting to create Hand Tracking, you need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" >Pycharm IDE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app on your PC.

Types Of Hand Tracking</h2><p>There are two main types of Hand Tracking: with interface and without interface:</p><h3 id="Tracking-With-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-With-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking With Interface"></a>Tracking With Interface</h3><p>With interface Hand Tracking, you need to use a device such as a glove or a controller to interact with the virtual world. This can be used in VR or AR applications. It is further divided into two systems:</p><p><strong>1. Inertial Motion Capture Gloves</strong></p><p>Inertial motion capture gloves use sensors Inertial Measurement Units or IMUs with built-in sensors to track the movement of your hands. These sensors include gyroscopes, accelerometers, and sometimes magnetometers for measuring angular rate, detecting gravitational force and acceleration, and measuring the earth’s magnetic field, respectively.</p><p>These gloves can be used for a variety of purposes, such as gaming, virtual reality, and motion capture for movies and video games. Inertial motion capture gloves are becoming increasingly popular as they offer a more immersive experience than traditional controllers.</p><p><strong>2. Optical Motion Capture Systems</strong></p><p>Optical motion capture is a process that uses cameras and reflective sensors to track movement in three-dimensional space. These systems are often used in movies and video games to create realistic animations.</p><p>Optical motion capture systems emit infrared light from the camera. The markers reflect light, which is then captured by cameras. The movement of the markers is then used to create a three-dimensional model of the object.</p><p>The more cameras used, the more accurate the results. While this technology is very precise, it can be limited by factors such as body position and movement.</p><h3 id="Tracking-Without-Interface-1"><a href="#Tracking-Without-Interface-1" class="headerlink" title="Tracking Without Interface"></a>Tracking Without Interface</h3><p>Also known as Markerless Hand Tracking, this type of Hand Tracking allows users to track their hand movements without the need for any external markers or data gloves, meaning more spontaneous interaction and freedom of movement. This could hugely impact everything from gaming to virtual reality to human-computer interaction.</p><p>Right now, markerless Hand Tracking is still in its early stages, with a few limitations. However, as this technology continues to develop, we will likely see more and more applications for it in the future.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1"><a href="#Part-3-Using-Python-OpenCV-And-MediaPipe-To-Create-A-Hand-Tracking-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking"></a>Part 3. Using Python, OpenCV, And MediaPipe To Create A Hand Tracking</h2><p>Above we have learned what is Hand Tracking and the two types of it. Now let’s see how we can create a hand tracking with two Python Libraries - OpenCV and MediaPipe.</p><p>Before we go further about them, let us learn about Python quickly. Python is a versatile language used for a wide range of tasks, including image processing and computer vision. We will use Python and two Python Libraries: OpenCV and MediaPipe, to create a Hand Tracking module.</p><h3 id="What-is-OpenCV-1"><a href="#What-is-OpenCV-1" class="headerlink" title="What is OpenCV"></a>What is OpenCV</h3><p>To get a deeper understanding of OpenCV, please read our article: <em>Opencv Tracking, a compete review</em>.（同期交付文章，请插入相关内链~）</p><h3 id="What-Is-Media-Pipe-1"><a href="#What-Is-Media-Pipe-1" class="headerlink" title="What Is Media Pipe"></a>What Is Media Pipe</h3><p>Media Pipe is an open-source framework by Google that provides a set of tools for working with multimedia data or media processing. It includes modules for handling audio, video, and images. Media Pipe also supports various codecs and file formats.</p><p>There are two stages for creating a Hand Tracking program using MediaPipe:</p><ol><li><strong>Palm Detection</strong>: In the first stage, MediaPipe has to work with the entire input image, providing a cropped image of the hand.</li><li><strong>Hand Landmarks Identification</strong>: In the second stage, the framework works with the cropped image of the hand to find 21 hand landmarks.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/20-hand-landmarks-for-identifiction-hand-tracking.jpg"                      alt="20 hand landmarks for identifiction – hand tracking"                ></p><h3 id="Guidance-With-Steps-1"><a href="#Guidance-With-Steps-1" class="headerlink" title="Guidance With Steps"></a>Guidance With Steps</h3><p>Before starting to create Hand Tracking, you need to install the <a class="link"   href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows" >Pycharm IDE <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app on your PC.
