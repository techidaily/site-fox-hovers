Now, by integrating Artificial Intelligent features, we can use any online photo background changer to instantly remove the existing background of our images (or replace it with a new one). From all the available options, I have listed some of the most perfect photo background changer tools that you can readily use.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-Changing-the-Background-in-your-Photos"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Need-for-Changing-the-Background-in-your-Photos" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Need for Changing the Background in your Photos?</h2><p>Ideally, you can consider using an image background changer due to either of the following reasons:</p><ul><li>While clicking an image, there could be unwanted objects or too many people in the background.</li><li>You might have to completely remove the background of an image and use it for any other purpose.</li><li>Chances are that you might want to use your photo for a professional task, and its background could not be so appealing.</li><li>There could be any other creative reason for you to remove the background of a photo and apply any other layer instead.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Top-10-Online-Photo-Background-Changers"><a href="#Part-2-Top-10-Online-Photo-Background-Changers" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers"></a>Part 2: Top 10+ Online Photo Background Changers</h2><p>If you are looking for a reliable online photo background changer tool, then you can consider exploring the following solutions:</p><h4 id="2-Remove-BG"><a href="#2-Remove-BG" class="headerlink" title="2. Remove BG"></a>2. Remove BG</h4><p>Remove BG is a perfect photo background changer tool that is extremely easy to use. Once the photo is uploaded, it will automatically detect human figures and will remove its background. You can then add any other background of your choice – texture, bold colors, customized images, and so on. If you want, you can freely download the image for 0.25 megapixels, but to download an HD image, you have to pay one credit per photo.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-removebg.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer removebg"                ></p><h4 id="3-Adobe-Spark"><a href="#3-Adobe-Spark" class="headerlink" title="3. Adobe Spark"></a>3. Adobe Spark</h4><p>If you are looking for a hassle-free solution to change a photo’s background, then you can also try Adobe Spark. The online tool is powered by Adobe and will let you upload any JPG or PNG photos. Afterward, the application will remove the background of the image and will let you save it as a PNG file that you can overlap on any background of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-spark.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer spark"                ></p><h4 id="4-Wondershare-PixCut"><a href="#4-Wondershare-PixCut" class="headerlink" title="4. Wondershare PixCut"></a>4. Wondershare PixCut</h4><p>Developed by Wondershare, PixCut is a free online background changer tool that you can use on any browser. To use it, you just have to go to its official website and simply upload any photo. Now, the online tool would automatically remove the background of your photo with its smart AI features. Later, PixCut will let you save the file in the PNG format that you can edit on any application on your system or mobile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wondershare-pixcut.jpg"                      alt="wondershare pixcut"                ></p><h4 id="5-Slazzer-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#5-Slazzer-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="5. Slazzer Photo Background Remover"></a>5. Slazzer Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Slazzer has come up with a wide range of utility tools, including an online photo background changer. The tool supports PNG and JPG files and would let you automatically remove the background of an image. Its AI features can automatically detect all the popular figures like human faces, cars, trees, pets, and so on. However, using Slazzer, you can only remove the background of an image and would have to insert a new background on another tool.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-slazzer.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer slazzer"                ></p><h4 id="6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer"><a href="#6-Fotor-Photo-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="6. Fotor Photo Background Changer"></a>6. Fotor Photo Background Changer</h4><p>Fotor offers a couple of online features related to photo editing and this one is another smart tool that you can use on its website. The image background changer is easy to use, can remove the background of any photo, and let you replace it with a new one. While it offers some of the most advanced features for online image editing, the application is not available for free (and would cost around $8.99 per month).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-fotor.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer fotor"                ></p><h4 id="7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#7-Clip-Magic-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover"></a>7. Clip Magic Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Clip Magic also offers a smart and quick solution to change the background of an image online. Once the photo is loaded to the online application, it will let you get rid of the background easily (without any technical hassle). Apart from that, you can also use its smart editor to make all kinds of minor changes to your photos easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-clip-magic.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer clip magic"                ></p><h4 id="8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover"><a href="#8-Edit-Photos-for-Free-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover"></a>8. Edit Photos for Free Background Remover</h4><p>As the name suggests, this is a freely available image editor that can also be used to change a photo’s background. Since it is an online tool, you can use it on any website without downloading anything on your system. Once the photo is manually uploaded, the application will automatically detect a figure (like a human face, car, or any other object). It will now crop the area of the figure and would remove its background, letting you change it later on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/photo-background-changer-edit-photos.jpg"                      alt="photo background changer edit photos"                ></p><h4 id="9-Foco-Clipping"><a href="#9-Foco-Clipping" class="headerlink" title="9. Foco Clipping"></a>9. Foco Clipping</h4><p>The next perfect photo background changer that I would recommend is from Foco Clipping. One of the best things about this online tool is that it can remove the background of multiple images at the same time. You can upload your photos in a bulk, let it process them, and remove their background. The image background changer is known for its exceptional results for cropping human figures with precise body and hair scaling.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-foco.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer foco"                ></p><h4 id="10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer"><a href="#10-PicsArt-Image-Background-Changer" class="headerlink" title="10.PicsArt Image Background Changer"></a>10.PicsArt Image Background Changer</h4><p>The online photo background changer by PicsArt is quite easy to use and offers a wide range of features. You can upload your photos one by one and can manually edit them on its interface. The application can automatically remove the background of your image and would let you save it as a PNG file on your system (to be used offline with any other application).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-picsart.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer picsart"                ></p><h4 id="11-Cut-Out-Pro-Photo-Background-Remover"><a href="#11-Cut-Out-Pro-Photo-Background-Remover" class="headerlink" title="11. Cut Out Pro Photo Background Remover"></a>11. Cut Out Pro Photo Background Remover</h4><p>Lastly, if you are looking for a free online background changer tool, then you can head to the website of Cut Out Pro. You can upload a photo from your computer’s storage or simply paste its URL. The application can automatically detect human figures, pets, cars, trees, designs, and several other objects. After removing the background, you can apply any other color, effect, or design as a background on its native interface as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/online-photo-background-changer-cutout.jpg"                      alt="online photo background changer cutout"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to do a background change online of any photo of yours.

These videos show the benefits of a particular idea, product, or service with the help of concise text, infographics, appropriate narration, and images. In the business sphere, video presentations are used for everything – from marketing and increasing sales to B2B interactions and training employees.</p><p>Video presentations are used by businesses as a solution for video marketing on various channels, including email newsletters and social media.

Opt for Video presentations. Being much more appealing and interesting than regular cut-and-dry presentations, videos can deliver results. Some of the many benefits of using videos in your presentations are:</p><h4 id="1-Captures-People’s-Attention"><a href="#1-Captures-People’s-Attention" class="headerlink" title="1.  Captures People’s Attention"></a>1.  Captures People’s Attention</h4><p>Video presentations can grab the attention of the audience immediately. Videos offer you a delightful way to treat the audience, thus bringing your message to life in a way no other medium can. By incorporating interactive video presentation ideas, you can improve the viewer’s experience as well as utilize sound and sight to reel the audience in.</p><h4 id="2-Persuasive"><a href="#2-Persuasive" class="headerlink" title="2.  Persuasive"></a>2.  Persuasive</h4><p>Creating engaging video presentations can be a great way to persuade your target audience. Provoking emotional responses by incorporating audio-visual storytelling, adding sounds and sights into the mix, and bringing emotions can help you persuade your audience.</p><h4 id="3-Accessible-Anytime-Anywhere"><a href="#3-Accessible-Anytime-Anywhere" class="headerlink" title="3.  Accessible Anytime, Anywhere"></a>3.  Accessible Anytime, Anywhere</h4><p>People nowadays love spending time on their phones and tablets and so they prefer watching videos on them. This makes video presentations accessible anywhere, anytime. And with people becoming more reliant on technology at large, consider embracing videos to have a greater impact on viewers.</p><h4 id="4-Time-Efficient"><a href="#4-Time-Efficient" class="headerlink" title="4.  Time Efficient"></a>4.  Time Efficient</h4><p>Video presentations are specifically meant to allow the presenter to break down the information into smaller chunks. This way, viewers can digest larger amounts of information easily and quickly. Making video presentations can thus be a more time-effective decision.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-presentation-time-efficient.jpg"                      alt="Video Presentation Time Efficient"                ></p><h2 id="12-Creative-Video-Presentation-Ideas-to-Wow-Your-Audience"><a href="#12-Creative-Video-Presentation-Ideas-to-Wow-Your-Audience" class="headerlink" title="12 Creative Video Presentation Ideas to Wow Your Audience"></a>12 Creative Video Presentation Ideas to Wow Your Audience</h2><h4 id="1-Start-With-A-Provocative-Statement"><a href="#1-Start-With-A-Provocative-Statement" class="headerlink" title="1.  Start With A Provocative Statement"></a>1.  Start With A Provocative Statement</h4><p>Making a provocative statement when presenting your video can grab the attention of your audience right from the get-go. When your statement offers something a little controversial or maybe a bit offensive and unexpected, it makes people sit up and take notice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-presentation-provocative-statement.jpg"                      alt="Video Presentation Provocative Statement"                ></p><p><em>“People don’t care about your brand.”</em> Reading this, anyone will be compelled to see how the presenter justifies his&#x2F;her point, isn’t it? The video begins with an unpredicted statement, explains why, and later shows what needs to be done for overcoming the hurdle.</p><h4 id="2-Narrate-a-Story"><a href="#2-Narrate-a-Story" class="headerlink" title="2.  Narrate a Story"></a>2.  Narrate a Story</h4><p>One of the most interesting video presentation ideas to grab your audience’s attention is telling a story that evokes their emotions. Narrating a personal story can work wonders as the audience can relate to it on an individual level. Think about some stand-out examples of human stories that relate to your business so that people can connect with the central character.</p><p>Here, Nike – one of the top brands in the world encourages women around the world to fulfill their dreams. Be it gender inequality or playing soccer, it asks women to do what they want.</p><h4 id="3-Ask-Questions-or-Have-a-Q-A-Session"><a href="#3-Ask-Questions-or-Have-a-Q-A-Session" class="headerlink" title="3.  Ask Questions or Have a Q&amp;A Session"></a>3.  Ask Questions or Have a Q&amp;A Session</h4><p>Do you wish to get the audience involved? Ask questions right away! Questions and Q&amp;A sessions break up the regular presentation rhythm and help in marking whatever you say as important. This way, you can turn your presentation from a boring activity into an active quest that your audience loves exploring on their own through answers.</p><h4 id="4-Use-Visual-Metaphors"><a href="#4-Use-Visual-Metaphors" class="headerlink" title="4.  Use Visual Metaphors"></a>4.  Use Visual Metaphors</h4><p>Texts are less memorable and combining visuals with your message can help you grab the attention of the audience during your presentation. Visual metaphors are an excellent way to use images. In fact, visual images of situations that people are already familiar with help retain points much longer in their memory.</p><h4 id="5-Add-Music"><a href="#5-Add-Music" class="headerlink" title="5.  Add Music"></a>5.  Add Music</h4><p>Music has the power to enhance and support emotions in video presentations, as well as proven to sustain the attention of people and help in information retention. As per the <a class="link"   href="https://www.ronberk.com/articles/2011%5Fresearch.pdf" >research <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of The John Hopkins University’s Ronald A. Berk, <em>“Music embedded throughout a PowerPoint presentation can sustain attention while slipping the content into long-term memory.”</em> Incorporating music is one of the most amazing video presentation ideas you can take inspiration from.</p><h4 id="6-Break-It-Up-With-Humorous-Memes"><a href="#6-Break-It-Up-With-Humorous-Memes" class="headerlink" title="6.  Break It Up With Humorous Memes"></a>6.  Break It Up With Humorous Memes</h4><p>You’ve seen memes everywhere and you might even be sick of them. But, that doesn’t mean memes cannot be useful. In fact, using memes strategically can not only make your audience laugh but also surprise them.</p><h4 id="7-Add-Motion-Graphics"><a href="#7-Add-Motion-Graphics" class="headerlink" title="7.  Add Motion Graphics"></a>7.  Add Motion Graphics</h4><p>Motion graphics are an excellent way to illustrate an innovative idea with animated objects. When you add motion graphics in your presentation, it captures people’s attention instantly.</p><p>The video above shows how you can use motion graphics on the English alphabets.</p><h4 id="8-Use-Quotes-between-Slides"><a href="#8-Use-Quotes-between-Slides" class="headerlink" title="8.  Use Quotes between Slides"></a>8.  Use Quotes between Slides</h4><p>Quotes can be great breathers between groups of informative slides. You can either use quotes to start new sections of information or to separate ideas inside your video presentation. Make sure that the quotes you are using represent the topic of your presentation. This way, you can be confident they will make complete sense and not leave the viewers confused.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-quotes-between-slides.jpg"                      alt="Quotes between Slides"                ></p><p><strong>Source:</strong> &lt;<a href="http://www.behance.net>">www.behance.net&gt;</a></p><h4 id="9-Add-an-Audio-Narration"><a href="#9-Add-an-Audio-Narration" class="headerlink" title="9.  Add an Audio Narration"></a>9.  Add an Audio Narration</h4><p>No matter how long or short your presentation is, narration can give it a completely different mood, especially if the words are heartfelt and the voice is powerful. Use the voice to change the pace or tone of your presentation and it will keep the audience to your video. Furthermore, adding an audio narrative into your slideshow can be an excellent way to create an interactive presentation experience.</p><h4 id="10-Play-with-Animations-and-Transitions"><a href="#10-Play-with-Animations-and-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="10.  Play with Animations and Transitions"></a>10.  Play with Animations and Transitions</h4><p>One of the greatest advantages of videos over the standard presentations is that you can do all kinds of trendy things. Animations and transitions can pull your audience in and help you bring focus to crucial areas and ensure that viewers engage with you. Video content lets you condense complex ideas in seconds, the video below from <a class="link"   href="https://www.yumyumvideos.com/" >Yum Yum Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows how to deliver messages in a compelling and empathetic way with explainer videos.</p><h4 id="11-Turn-Your-Slides-into-a-Scrolling-Infographic"><a href="#11-Turn-Your-Slides-into-a-Scrolling-Infographic" class="headerlink" title="11.  Turn Your Slides into a Scrolling Infographic"></a>11.  Turn Your Slides into a Scrolling Infographic</h4><p>Line up your slides vertically for creating a scrolling infographic rather than a classic slide by slide transition presentation. When the viewer scrolls down, the information fills every slide progressively. In fact, this technique is ideal for displaying video presentations online.</p><h4 id="12-End-On-A-Meaningful-Strong-Note"><a href="#12-End-On-A-Meaningful-Strong-Note" class="headerlink" title="12.

In case the previous century was considered to be the age of mass production and the growth of the internet, the 21th century will be known for the development and expansion of the virtual world. One of the products of this technological evolution is the Metaverse. This is what we are going to take a look at in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What a Metaverse Could Look Like?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What Can You Do in the Metaverse?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">What to Prepare Before Joining the Metaverse?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-a-Metaverse-Could-Look-Like"><a href="#Part-1-What-a-Metaverse-Could-Look-Like" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What a Metaverse Could Look Like?"></a>Part 1: What a Metaverse Could Look Like?</h2><p>Metaverse is a combination of different technological elements, including AR, VR, and video where the users live inside a virtual universe. The advocates of Metaverse envision the users playing, working, or remaining connected with their loved ones through everything, from conferences to concerts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/what-is-metaverse.jpg"                      alt="What is Metaverse"                ></p><p>Source: techidence.com</p><p>In simple words, it refers to a shared virtual platform, which people will be able to access from various devices and where they will be able to move through virtual environments.</p><p>The entire concept might be almost a decade away from being completely recognized but it will require the tech giants to cooperate with each other.</p><p>In the month of June, Roundhill Investment, the investment firm, had created an ETF, an exchange-traded fund for tracking profit from the work of Metaverse users. Thereafter, Facebook announced its rebranding.</p><p>Today, we only have the primitive forerunners of a real Metaverse, Minecraft, Roblox, and other digital user-created worlds. One of the good examples of this idea is Fortnite, a battle royal video game taking place in a large social world. It is an idea as to what some aspects of the Metaverse might look like. Another incredible aspect is the video-conferencing apps. The only difference between this and the actual thing is the real Metaverse is not going to be limited to one game, app, virtual world, or company. It is going to connect them all.</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-You-Do-in-the-Metaverse"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-You-Do-in-the-Metaverse" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?"></a>Part 2: What Can You Do in the Metaverse?</h2><p>Here are some great examples of the Metaverse.</p><h3 id="1-Ready-Player-One"><a href="#1-Ready-Player-One" class="headerlink" title="1.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="10-Key-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art"><a href="#10-Key-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art" class="headerlink" title="10 Key Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art"></a>10 Key Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art</h2><p>Research suggests people make up their mind within 90 seconds after the initial interaction with the brand and associate it as either bad or good. Many podcasters only focus on the podcast’s content, which they should, but ignore the visual identity of the podcast.</p><p>In this guide, we will guide you to design a stunning and unique podcast cover. But before that, we will acquaint you with all the necessary elements of an eye-catching podcast cover image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast cover image"                ></p><h2 id="Round-Up-10-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art"><a href="#Round-Up-10-Tips-to-Design-Podcast-Cover-Art" class="headerlink" title="Round-Up 10 Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art"></a>Round-Up 10 Tips to Design Podcast Cover Art</h2><p>These are not tips but 101 guides on podcast cover-making. All the ten key points mentioned here will enable you to create a podcast cover image that stands out and catch the user’s attention.</p><h3 id="1-Make-sure-the-podcast-cover-meets-podcast-platform-requirements"><a href="#1-Make-sure-the-podcast-cover-meets-podcast-platform-requirements" class="headerlink" title="1. Make sure the podcast cover meets podcast platform requirements"></a>1. Make sure the podcast cover meets podcast platform requirements</h3><p>To make your podcast accessible to people worldwide, you have to publish them to podcast platforms, otherwise known as podcast directories. For instance, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts are podcast directories.</p><p>The good thing is most podcast directories have a similar requirement for the podcast cover art dimensions, resolution, and file type. Still, some podcast directories have special needs. So, ensure to know the requirement of each podcast directory that you plan to publish your podcasts on and select the canvas accordingly.</p><p>For instance, the podcast cover size demanded by Apple Podcast is:</p><ul><li>3000 x 3000 pixels</li><li>Resolution of 72 dpi</li><li>JPG or PNG file type</li><li>RGB color-space</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-2.jpg"                      alt="apple podcast cover image"                ></p><p>Google Podcasts, a popular podcast platform among Android users, also has the same or similar requirements for the podcast cover image. That is to say, you do not have to design a podcast cover exclusive to Google Podcasts.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are some platforms that have different requirements. For instance, Spotify mentions the following need for a podcast cover image:</p><ul><li>TIFF, PNG, or JPG format using loss-less encoding</li><li>The highest resolution available</li><li>At least 640px wide and tall</li><li>1:1 aspect ratio</li><li>Encoded with an sRGB color space, 24bits per pixel, with color profiles applied directly.</li></ul><p><strong>Note</strong>: The thing to remember is to design podcast covers for all platforms with different requirements. It may seem daunting, but limitations and provisions often unleash a person’s creativity. Needless to say, if you are a professional podcaster and your teammates responsible for podcast cover making, then you can leave it to them.</p><h3 id="2-Straight-to-the-point"><a href="#2-Straight-to-the-point" class="headerlink" title="2. Straight to the point"></a>2. Straight to the point</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-3.jpg"                      alt="podcast straight to the point image"                ></p><p>People often confuse “straight to the point” with plain and simple. However, it is an unjust explanation of what is straight to the point. Additionally, achieving the “straight to the point” scale is not simple.</p><p>Put, “straight to the point” means something that best projects your podcast theme with a user who has never even engaged with your podcast. For instance, if your podcast discusses movies, then do not simply design a podcast cover with the blockbuster sign.</p><p>Instead, brainstorm ideas for what you often differ in the podcast, like a specific genre or movie series. Once you narrow down the ideas, you can design a podcast cover that is straight to the point, i.e., it conveys the message creatively.</p><p>Here are some examples to help you think in the “straight to the point” fashion:</p><p><strong>Example #1 ― Entrepreneurs like it simple, plain, and sophisticated.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-4.jpg"                      alt="podcast straight to the point image"                ></p><p>The above podcast cover designs are related to business. If you carefully review each of them, you will find the human element. The human element is a necessary factor in business-related podcasts. It is what allows business professionals to connect with the experts and attracts them to the podcasts.</p><p>Another thing to review is the color palettes used by the entrepreneurs. The colors used in the podcast cover photos by hosts are often subtle yet bright and reek of sophistication.</p><p><strong>Example #2 ― Comedians Making the Most from Their Podcast Cover Photos.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-5.jpg"                      alt="podcast comedy covers"                ></p><p>Comedy podcasts don’t seem like much, but they have a huge user following. Do you know how? Well, they attract users in bulk with their funky, impressive, and immersive cover images. Notice the clever use of colors on all the podcast cover designs. Moreover, the typography used in these cover images is also unsophisticated and often conveys that this isn’t something serious.</p><h3 id="3-Avoid-Inappropriate-Words-or-Imagery"><a href="#3-Avoid-Inappropriate-Words-or-Imagery" class="headerlink" title="3. Avoid Inappropriate Words or Imagery"></a>3. Avoid Inappropriate Words or Imagery</h3><p>Swearing and inappropriate imagery is part of today’s taboo culture. However, it offends users. You have to retain that the podcast-listening community is an informed one. It’s not about becoming cool, but it’s about delivering cool information.</p><p>Not to mention, using explicit languages is also restricted by podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. So, you may also get banned for using offensive words or imagery in your podcast cover photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-6.jpg"                      alt="podcast explicit covers"                ></p><p>The recent policies of podcast directories like Apple Podcast have changed drastically. For instance, you could have gotten away with using asterisk marks in some words (like sh*t); however, it is not the case today. Your podcast will receive multiple notifications from the platform managers to remove the banner, and in some cases, the directories can also ban you from the platform. So, it is best to play it safe and use professional language, at least in the podcast cover photos.</p><h3 id="4-Color-Matters"><a href="#4-Color-Matters" class="headerlink" title="4. Color Matters"></a>4. Color Matters</h3><p>There are trends in book cover design and movie cover design, and then comes the trends in podcast cover design. You will be surprised to know the amount of time each podcaster spent on deciding the right color for the cover art.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-7.jpg"                      alt="podcast colors covers"                ></p><p>Color is something that not many businesses pay attention to, but it has a profound effect on users. To just give you an example of how deep businesses think about the color of their business, there is a separate domain after colors: color branding.</p><p>Yes, businesses spent a lot of brainstorming sessions to combine color theory and business. Here are some of the most prominent trends in the podcast world today and their significance:</p><p><strong>Example # 1. Red background with light text</strong></p><p>If you are into sales, you might already be familiar with the concept of red. Basically, red is the color of love, excitement, and anger. And the combination of these emotions allows businesses to create a sense of urgency among users. You can use the same psychology in the podcast world and let new users discover you through this psychological trick.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-8.jpg"                      alt="podcast red covers"                ></p><p>Today, almost all domains in the podcast world use the red color and combine it with black or white text to entice users about their podcast episodes. You can find such podcast covers on topics ranging from history to anthropology, psychology to music, and so on.</p><p><strong>Example #2. Blue background with light text</strong></p><p>Blue is the color of trust, competency, and quality. To loosely translate its psychological effects on an average human, blue creates a sense of dependability, logic, and peace. So, if your podcast is on medical topics or something calm, a blue podcast cover photo is the way to go.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-9.jpg"                      alt="podcast blue covers"                ></p><p>There are numerous other examples like this. For instance, even black ink on a grey palette is a trend. After studying their psychological effects on your users, you can choose from any number of colors and combinations.</p><p>It is important to retain that color psychology is not about tricking people. Instead, it is about learning the effects of color on people mind’s and using one that best describes your episodes. So, research this in-depth and choose a color that resonates with your content and also impresses users.</p><h3 id="5-Typography-will-help"><a href="#5-Typography-will-help" class="headerlink" title="5. Typography will help"></a>5. Typography will help</h3><p>A debate that long started at the advent of the internet and is still continuing is the effects of fonts on readability. Some recent <a class="link"   href="https://www.canva.com/learn/serif-vs-sans-serif-fonts/" >studies from Canva have revealed that fonts have a lot <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to do with readability. But most important of all, fonts have a huge effect on people’s emotions.</p><p>For instance, serif fonts have long been used in newspapers, magazines, and even web pages. That is why most users associate serif fonts with classical, nostalgic, and often professional or formal. And it is thus suitable when you are creating a professional podcast discussing business, education, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-10.jpg"                      alt="podcast typography covers"                ></p><p>Sans serif is the new thing. It is all about throwing the tradition of using Serif fonts out of the window and using a fun and exciting and allowing users to read conveniently on the web-pages.</p><p>But typography does not mean it’s all about the font itself. The size of the font, the spaces in between the fonts, and the color of the font all play a differential role. So, ensure to learn about all the intricacies of typography and accordingly use fonts, their size, the gap in between them, their color, and so on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/design-podcast-cover-11.jpg"                      alt="podcast typography blendcovers"                ></p><p>Additionally, you should focus on blending the typography with imagery. The combination of both often becomes messy and unreadable; of course, the creativity lies in</p><h3 id="6-Unique-and-high-resolution-images"><a href="#6-Unique-and-high-resolution-images" class="headerlink" title="6. Unique and high-resolution images"></a>6. Unique and high-resolution images</h3><p>A unique picture is what differentiates you from others. A user can easily locate and revisit your episodes if you use a unique-looking podcast cover. However, in addition to the unique design of the podcast cover, you should also ensure it is in high resolution.</p><p>Retain that a high-resolution picture speaks about class, professionalism, and sophistication, regardless of what you discuss in the podcast. At the same time, a low-resolution podcast is unsuitable and looks un-classy in the digital era.</p><h3 id="7-Brand-consistency"><a href="#7-Brand-consistency" class="headerlink" title="7. Brand consistency"></a>7. Brand consistency</h3><p>Of course, A&#x2F;B testing in the initial phases is necessary to test the design of the podcast cover. However, such tests are suitable for a short period of time. Ensure to spend enough time beforehand, so you do not have to change the design of the podcast cover often.</p><p>Brands like Coca-Cola, Nike, and Apple use consistency in their images and logos and ensure that all platforms have a similar brand image. This allows the users to recognize the brand, and the picture sits in the user’s mind. So, ensure consistency across all platforms and use the same cover images on all podcast directories.</p><h3 id="8-Image-compression"><a href="#8-Image-compression" class="headerlink" title="8. Image compression"></a>8. Image compression</h3><p>Almost all podcast directories will recommend you compress the podcast cover image, and for good reasons. Firstly, a small image loads faster on the pages and allows users to interact with your podcast at first sight. Second, mobile apps and web pages are very different in nature from web platforms. And a lot of users listen to the podcast via their smart phones, so it is best to use compressed images.</p><p>An ideal podcast cover art dimension is 3000 x 3000 pixels, which is a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Some podcast platforms, like Buzzsprout, do the image compression on their end. So, ensure not to compress the image beforehand, as this will further shrink the size of the image.</p><h3 id="9-Design-for-a-variety-of-sizes-and-re-purpose-your-art"><a href="#9-Design-for-a-variety-of-sizes-and-re-purpose-your-art" class="headerlink" title="9. Design for a variety of sizes and re-purpose your art"></a>9. Design for a variety of sizes and re-purpose your art</h3><p>When you design the podcast cover, it is best to take different aspect ratios and dimensions and sketch your plan. This will allow you to be more creative, and of course, you can easily resize the banner for respective podcast directories.</p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Make-an-Attractive-Podcast-Cover-Easily-with-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Make-an-Attractive-Podcast-Cover-Easily-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Make an Attractive Podcast Cover Easily with Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip: Make an Attractive Podcast Cover Easily with Filmora</h2><p>Now that you know how to choose color, font, typography, and content for the podcast cover art, let’s learn how to combine all these elements and design a podcast cover that is unique, different, and impressive.</p><p>However, using an effective tool like Filmora to design podcast covers is important.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="A-Scriptwriter’s-Playbook"><a href="#A-Scriptwriter’s-Playbook" class="headerlink" title="A Scriptwriter’s Playbook"></a>A Scriptwriter’s Playbook</h2><p>A screenplay, also known as a script, is a piece of writing written by a screenwriter for a movie, television show, or video game. These screenplays may be original or modified from previously published material. They also describe the characters’ movements, actions, expressions, and dialogues. A teleplay is a screenplay written specifically for television.</p><p>A screenplay is a <strong>written text that serves as the foundation for film production</strong>. It usually includes not only the characters’ dialogue but also a shot-by-shot outline of the film’s action. This article will cover everything you need to know about screenplays.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-screenplay"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-screenplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is a screenplay?"></a>Part 1. What is a screenplay?</h2><p>A screenplay is a piece of writing that contains the dialogue for an entire film or television episode.</p><p>A screenplay can be based on original material, such as screenwriter ideas, or on pre-existing works, such as novels. The text is mostly dialogue, with descriptions of the environment, locations, scenery, costumes, and characters thrown in for good measure.</p><p>It can be used to ensure that everything in your story is consistent with what you’ve shot. It can also be used to assist with editing!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-1.jpg"                      alt="a screenplay"                ></p><p>A screenplay is a script for a film, television show, or play. It tells a story by using dialogue and action to show how the scenes are connected.</p><p>Are you considering writing a screenplay?</p><p>Are you wondering if it’s worth it?</p><p>This article will provide answers to your questions as well as resources to help you get started!</p><p>A screenplay is a story that describes what will be seen on film or television. They are written in a script format, which differs from novel writing.</p><p>The structure of a screenplay can differ depending on the type of film being produced and the amount of dialogue versus action.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Basic-standard-screenplay-formats"><a href="#Part-2-Basic-standard-screenplay-formats" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Basic standard screenplay formats"></a>Part 2. Basic standard screenplay formats</h2><p>Screenplay format is <strong>a collection of 12 different elements</strong>, and writers should keep in mind that formatting their screenplay will benefit them in the long run.</p><p>The first tip is to begin with Fade In, which is located at the top left of the page. This informs your reader of their location and serves as a template for what should be written in your script.</p><p>If you want to be a screenwriter, you must be familiar with the proper screenplay format. It is not sufficient to simply write the dialogue and action for your script.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-2.jpg"                      alt="basic standard screenplay formats"                ></p><p>You must also include all the other elements so that no one is confused about what each one means. Many factors must be considered when writing good screenplays, such as formatting to make the screenplay readable to others. The script should be formatted in accordance with industry standards, with adequate margins, spaces between dialogues and action lines, and so on, so that readers can easily follow it.</p><p>Screenplays are a type of written or visual storytelling in which <strong>dialogue, action, and description are all included</strong>. They are typically used in the film industry to pitch a film or television show idea. They can be either fiction or nonfiction, depending on whether they use fictional stories or real-life facts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Templates-for-screenplay"><a href="#Part-3-Templates-for-screenplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Templates for screenplay"></a>Part 3. Templates for screenplay</h2><p>In simple words, a screenplay format template is a ready-made structure into which characters, movements, and story elements can be inserted to create a usable screenplay. It is essentially a layout with specific characteristics that suit a particular genre of screenwriting.</p><p>A psychological thriller script, for example, will have a different structure and pace than an action script. Both genres have storyboard templates that can be used for a variety of stories from each genre.</p><p>A thriller script template will structure character movement, staging, and dialogue delivery to look and move like an ideal thriller while preventing it from looking and moving like an action element.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-3.jpg"                      alt="templates for screenplay"                ></p><p>We currently have screenplay format templates for nearly every theatrical and film genre, including drama, comedy, action, thriller, autobiography, and others. Each of these templates has a unique structure, but the best ones share some characteristics.</p><h3 id="1-Characteristics-of-the-Ideal-Screenplay-Format-Template"><a href="#1-Characteristics-of-the-Ideal-Screenplay-Format-Template" class="headerlink" title="1. Characteristics of the Ideal Screenplay Format Template"></a>1. Characteristics of the Ideal Screenplay Format Template</h3><p>Regardless of the screenplay genre, each screenplay template has some characteristics that set it apart from the rest. However, all ideal scenarios have the following characteristics in common:</p><ul><li>Complex layout</li><li>Current features</li><li>Configurability</li><li>Creative space</li></ul><p>Let’s look at each of the characteristics individually.</p><h3 id="2-Comprehensive-Layout"><a href="#2-Comprehensive-Layout" class="headerlink" title="2. Comprehensive Layout"></a>2. Comprehensive Layout</h3><p>If you look at the screenplays for some of the greatest movies ever made, you’ll find that they all contain a complete and detailed story arc with textbook variations in pacing and dialogue as the story progresses.</p><p>Yes, almost all screenplays have some holes that may have been overlooked in the writing, but as a structure, they will include all the essential aspects of the story they are telling.</p><p>That said, a great screenplay format template:</p><ul><li>Format by genre</li><li>Have enough space for brainstorming and subject research</li><li>Layout of main acts, chapters, and scenes</li><li>Leave room for editing characters and settings (left margin and right margin variations)</li><li>Easy to use for beginners</li></ul><p>Aside from some niche genres like anthology and neo-bizarro, every ideal screenplay format template has some combination of these qualities.</p><h3 id="3-Contemporary-Features"><a href="#3-Contemporary-Features" class="headerlink" title="3. Contemporary Features"></a>3. Contemporary Features</h3><p>Scenarios have had a similar structure since the beginning of the last century.</p><p>The same title page, with the same standard Courier font, text indentation, scene title&#x2F;slug line and subtitle prefixes (INT-EXT), action line layout, etc. All this has remained unchanged over the years.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-4.jpg"                      alt="contemporary features"                ></p><p>However, with the advent of app-based screenwriting software, we have plenty of contemporary features such as automatic page numbers, time of day, parentheses, and pop-ups with specific character names.</p><p>Even the general rule of thumb “one-page equals one minute of screen time” doesn’t apply to all scripts today.</p><p>While it’s not necessary to have a fully automated script layout interface, any task that can be automated gives the writer more time for important tasks like contributing to off-screen production, recording voice-overs, etc.</p><p>Plus, since most writers today prefer a smartphone to a traditional typewriter, it pays to have a screenplay editor in the palm of your hand.</p><h3 id="4-Configurability"><a href="#4-Configurability" class="headerlink" title="4. Configurability"></a>4. Configurability</h3><p>Rigid script formatting risks making your story look and sound like all the stories that have used it in the past.</p><p>The same events, the same character archetypes, the same moves and submissions, and the same build-ups can quickly become boring.</p><p>The best storyboard templates have a structure that is created with the genre of the story in mind but gives the writer room to play around with their characters, setting, etc.</p><p>For example, when I’m writing a character who’s learning to write a book, I’d like to show her picking up references from nature and various other creative genres and coming back to change her style—not just research from the works of other writers.</p><p>Taking an unconventional approach to character development can seem counterproductive and time-consuming. However, a good script draft will allow the writer to do this without making the script unbalanced.</p><h3 id="5-Creative-Space"><a href="#5-Creative-Space" class="headerlink" title="5. Creative Space"></a>5. Creative Space</h3><p>Stiffness is a very common factor in most traditional screenplay formats.</p><p>A certain rigidity is good because it keeps the story structured and prevents writers from focusing too deeply on one aspect and neglecting the rest.</p><p>However, script templates should not be too restrictive in terms of creative freedom for the writer.</p><p>For example, an ideal screenwriting template should allow one character out of several to experience a different phase of character development than the others at any point in the plot.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/what-is-screenplay-5.jpg"                      alt="creative space"                ></p><p>This prevents all characters from looking and sounding like they were cast from a similar mold and have no unique development of their own.</p><p>In addition, the best templates should allow screenwriters to adjust their plot development to write for feature films as well as series.</p><p>Common fictional tropes have already been adopted by thousands of screenwriters around the world.

Unboxing reels on Instagram will never be out of trend; thus, you need to work on your unboxing skills. It is essential for you to create attractive reels because these reels can drive 67% more engagement to your page. The tips mentioned below can help you proficiently in your <strong>unboxing Instagram</strong> success:</p><h3 id="Tip-1-Good-Camera-Equipment-and-Recording-Environment"><a href="#Tip-1-Good-Camera-Equipment-and-Recording-Environment" class="headerlink" title="Tip 1: Good Camera Equipment and Recording Environment"></a>Tip 1: Good Camera Equipment and Recording Environment</h3><p>You should have a good camera for shooting videos because it is a basic part of reels. If you shoot an <strong>unboxing video on Instagram</strong> without a good camera, it will bore the users. A high-quality camera will drive a high number of followers in a minimum time. A camera equipment like a tripod stand is a must for unboxing reels. With it, you can record reels without setting up the camera again and again.</p><p>As for the environment, make sure it’s tidy. People will not only focus on unboxing, but this factor is also a fundamental part of good Instagram reels. Simply put, always work with high-quality cameras and equipment in a clean and aesthetically pleasing space.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-reels-on-instagram-3.jpg"                      alt="use good recording equipment"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-2-Keep-the-Focus-on-the-Product-Throughout-the-Video"><a href="#Tip-2-Keep-the-Focus-on-the-Product-Throughout-the-Video" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Keep the Focus on the Product Throughout the Video"></a>Tip 2: Keep the Focus on the Product Throughout the Video</h3><p>Make sure to set the focus of your camera before recording reels. <strong>Unboxing the Instagram</strong> page should always focus on showing the product in higher quality. Imagine you shoot a video of a makeup box from Sephora, and if the focus is not on the box but on the table, do you think viewers will like it? They will ultimately bounce back, impacting your page’s followers and reels.</p><p>Thus, always give first priority to the product. It will be a positive thing for your unboxing influencer career. Keep your camera neat and clean, and check its focus from time to time while shooting the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/unboxing-reels-on-instagram-4.jpg"                      alt="have a proper angle of the product"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Keep-the-Video-Short"><a href="#Tip-3-Keep-the-Video-Short" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: Keep the Video Short"></a>Tip 3: Keep the Video Short</h3><p>This is very important that you do not exceed the time of Instagram reels. The ideal time limit for <strong>unboxing videos on Instagram</strong> is 15 to 60 seconds. Thus, make sure you never lengthen the video until necessary. It will help you give high-quality short and precise unboxing reels. Users can get what they are looking for in a limited time.</p><h3 id="Tip-4-Resize-your-Unboxing-Reels-to-Fit-Instagram"><a href="#Tip-4-Resize-your-Unboxing-Reels-to-Fit-Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Resize your Unboxing Reels to Fit Instagram"></a>Tip 4: Resize your Unboxing Reels to Fit Instagram</h3><p>The ideal size of Instagram’s <strong>unboxing reels</strong> is 1080x1920p. Confirm this resolution before posting a video so you will not face any problems in the future. Above all, there are both landscape and portrait reels, but the reliable ones are portrait. Posting the unboxing video in portrait mode will drive more followers to your page.</p><h3 id="Tip-5-Add-Captions-for-Your-Unboxing-Reels"><a href="#Tip-5-Add-Captions-for-Your-Unboxing-Reels" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Add Captions for Your Unboxing Reels"></a>Tip 5: Add Captions for Your Unboxing Reels</h3><p>Unboxing captions for Instagram can be a very helpful thing for many users.

When you add captions to an Instagram reel, it will assist you in standing apart from your competitors.</p><p>People can get what you are saying more clearly.

A soothing soundtrack can improve engagement and also attract music lovers. Alongside the unboxing captions, music is also a must-have for Instagram reels. Thus, select a piece of music that is like a melody to the ears.</p><p>Don’t try to add beatbox sounds in the videos because it will not suit them. However, you have to select a sound that matches the theme of your product. For example, selecting Disney music for toy unboxing Instagram is good. You can create an immersive and memorable user experience with an appealing soundtrack.</p><h3 id="Tip-7-Learn-More-From-Others"><a href="#Tip-7-Learn-More-From-Others" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Learn More From Others"></a>Tip 7: Learn More From Others</h3><p>There are uncountable <strong>unboxing reels</strong> on Instagram.
